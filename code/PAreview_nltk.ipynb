Being a food snob, when a group of friends suggested we go for dinner I looked online at the menu and to me there was nothing special and it seemed overpriced.  Im also not big on ordering pasta when I go out. Alas, I was outnumbered. Thank goodness! I ordered the sea bass special. It was to die for. Cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, perfect portion. I can not say enough good things about this dish. When the server asked how it was he seemed very proud of the dish and said, \" doesn\\'t she (the chef) do an incredible job?\" She does. \\n\\nMy hubby got the crab tortellini and also loved his. I heard \"mmmm this is so good\" from all around the table. Our waiter was super nice and even gave us free desserts because we were some of the last people in the restaurant. Service was very slow and the place was PACKED but we had our jugs of wine and a large group with good conversation so it didn\\'t seem to bother anyone.\\n\\nSo-\\n\\nDo order the calamari and fried zucchini appetizers. Leave out the mussels. \\n\\nIf they have the sea bass special, I highly recommend it. The chicken parm and crab tortellini were also very good and very big. The chicken Romano was a bit bland. The house salads were teeny. \\n\\nDo make a reservation but still expect to wait for your food. Go with a large group of people and plan for it to be loud. Don\\'t go with a date unless you\\'re fighting and don\\'t feel like hearing anything they have to say.  Ask to sit in the side room if it\\'s available.'},\n",

My husband had the veal with peppers and said it was so delicious and tender. The mashed potatoes were perfect. I had the salmon Diablo which was also delicious. Our salad was beautiful! Dressing was served on the salad and it was a nice amount. We ended our delicious meal with a piece of tiramisu. Our server Matt was right on!! Very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. Our appetizer, salad and entrees were timed perfectly. I love salad and did not mind that my entree was served while I was still eating it! No problem it let my dinner cool to just the right temp for me to eat it comfortably. \\nI wonder sometimes if people just don't appreciate relaxing and taking time to eat a wonderful and beautifully prepared meal.  A wonderful atmosphere. So relaxing. The chairs are super comfortable too!!! We will certainly be back. \\nGive it a try.

I used to (emphasis on the tense) go there every Tuesday for trivia night (the guy hosting is awesome). My service has been absolutely horrible every time except for once when a girl named Jess waited on us. The rest of the waitresses are completely incompetent and utterly rude off the bat. \\n\\nWhen we began ordering appetizers the waitress stopped us and asked if this was \"going to be complicated or not.\" She then forgot to put in an order for 1 of 3 appetizers ordered. It took about 15 mins after getting 2 of them, to even bring that to her attention, for which she didn\\'t even apologize. After 35mins and someone else bringing our food out, we finally had to go to the bar and ask someone to come take our drink orders, a task that was also messed up (I ordered their special of Big ass margeritas to which I received a small mason jar of mostly ice). They told me it\\'d be free, but it honestly wasn\\'t even worth that. After that, the only time I saw our waitress was when she was visibly talking about us and pointing with another waitress. Completely unprofessional. A different waitress had to bring us our checks and messed that up too. \\n\\nI had this same waitress the Tuesday before accompanied by the same crummy service. That\\'s when I realized that it wasn\\'t just a bad or busy night (it was a Tuesday for crying out loud), but that this woman is just REALLY bad at customer service.

       "  'text': \"Honestly I just don't get the how everyone is so in love with this place?  I'm not a native so when I moved to the area many years ago everyone advised my family that we absolutely had to try a burnt almond torte from Prantl's.  We did, and to be fair that is a great dessert.  However, I have worked across the street from them for a decade now, and the office ladies I work with have brought in nearly everything they sell at Prantl's over the last decade.  The cookies, the cupcakes, the junior pastries, danishes, donuts, etc... have all made there way into our office, and I have never been wowed by any of them.  In fact I find most items to be pretty sub par.  I think if Prantl's wasn't a true bakery and merely a shop that produced one signature cake it would probably deserve five stars, but that's not the case, and since I have to judge on the totality of their products as a bakery, not only the burnt almond torte which is their claim to fame and recognition, I find them to be quite lackluster overall.  If you want a true bakery treat I would suggest  La Gourmandine for anything, Vanilla for cupcakes, Jean Marc Chatellier, even the somewhat overrated Oakmont Bakery, as other than the burnt almond torte, you are paying specialty bakery prices but getting Giant Eagle quality, which is fine, but at that point you might as well go to Giant Eagle and pay accordingly.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"We just returned here for our second visit on New Year's Eve (our first visit was a NYE a few years back), and I'm just as in love with the place as I was before.  Sure, it's a splurge (which is why we only end up here on New Year's Eve), but it's a worthy splurge.\\n\\nThis NYE, they had a prix fixe menu, in addition to a smaller-than-normal regular menu, but since we are samplers, we decided to each get the 5-course prix fixe so we could try as many things as possible.\\n\\nI love that a trip to Sonoma Grille is not just dinner, it's an entire event.  Our waitress, Barb, was fantastic - knowledgeable about the menu, and passionate about it too.  They had just introduced some new items, so the servers had recently done their menu taste-test, and to hear her describe everything was like being there in the room as each dish was sampled and explained.\\n\\nSonoma Grille is regularly recognized as having one of the best wine selections in the city, and it's true.  The markup is a bit much, but again, you're paying for atmosphere and experience in addition to good California wines (I'd love to see a bit more Central Coast, as that's my favorite wine region, but the name is 'Sonoma,' so I give them a pass).  The staff can answer any question you have about the wine, which I really appreciate.\\n\\nWe started with the 'Trio of Amuse' appetizer, which had a parsnip bisque (light and flavorful), some oysters (which weird me out a bit, I must admit), and a teeny tiny beef carpaccio that was perfect in every way.  It was just one little nibble, but it was an insane burst of flavor.  While we were enjoying our wine and appetizer, the bread server came around with a selection of four different kinds of bread.  Instead of an individual table serving being brought to your table, a server comes with a large basket and serves you a few pieces of your choosing, plus olive oil for dipping.  I don't know why, but I love this little unique aspect of this restaurant.\\n\\nFor the larger appetizer (oh yes, two appetizers), we each got the jumbo lump crab and avocado plate.  This was gigantic - we could have easily split one between the two of us.  The crab pieces were huge, easily the size of garlic bulbs.  My only suggestion for this would be to have a few pieces of the crostini instead of just a little sliver at the bottom.  The actual plate was quite juicy, and the crunch of the crostini was a good balance.  Mmm, this was like crab guacamole, so in other words, amazing.\\n\\nMy husband and I each got different salads.  He opted for the fois gras salad (which he loved, even though I was a bit too squeamish to sample it), and I got what I shall refer to as the pile 'o beets.  Anyone who knows me knows my love affair with beets, and this was just perfect.  Slices of beets interspersed with goat cheese and well-seasoned... wish I could eat that every day.  Not very 'salad-y' but heavenly nonetheless.\\n\\nThere were five different options for entrees, but we both had our eye on only one thing: the filet mignon.  Oh. My. Word.  This steak was cooked to perfection - so tender and juicy that my mouth is watering just remembering it!  It came with garlicky whipped potatoes and broccolini (which I delicately pushed to the side - sorry broccoli, we're never going to be friends).  The portion was huge, and I had the second half wrapped up for lunch the next day.\\n\\nWe were nearly too full for dessert, but had to make room to try the chocolate ravioli.  It's a little weird, and the texture is a bit chewier than I would have thought, but the flavor was excellent.  It came with a nice blend of raspberry and vanilla sauce for dipping, and was perfect alongside a steaming cup of coffee.\\n\\nAll in all, we had another excellent experience.  Barb even offered to keep my leftovers in the fridge until after the midnight festivities, but I was afraid I'd forget in the massive crowd leaving downtown, so we walked it back to the car anyway.  I was not going to let myself miss out on a second meal of that filet in the aftermath of Pittsburgh fireworks lol.  This is one NYE tradition we plan on keeping for many years to come!\"},\n",

I think I've ordered the tofu tacos 20 times and I never even really liked them that much, they're just too cheap to pass up. The tofu bites are okay, too, with spicy wing sauces but nothing too special there. The mac n cheese is amazing, like everyone has said, but it is a recipe for a heart attack and doesn't pair well with a night out drinking.\\n\\nThe cocktails, on the other hand, are crazy good.

       "  'text': 'I do not get what everyone is talking about; I am guessing all of these reviews are from young hipsters or pretentious middle age drones looking for some cool in their life. Let me start by saying that I enjoy what I call \"casual elegance.\" I like good upscale food, in a modern, casual atmosphere, with a laid back nice, but down to earth vibe. Somewhere like SIX PENN Kitchen or something. I decided to come here after reading many great reviews on Yelp. This place is comical, trys wayy to hard!\\n\\nIt is very small, tables very close. Low ceiling/dark paint so it feels very claustrophobic. It does describe itself as a lounge so I will give them that; if you like swanky lounge vibe this place is actually pretty nice. Too dark and small for my liking. The waiter, dressed in his skinny jeans and pompadour brought over a bottle of tap water to pour. We politely decline b/c I didn\\'t want water so why waste it..ya know. He seemed offended that I didn\\'t want water, he offered us wine, and we declined, I just wanted a diet coke because I was on call for work and could not drink. He became aloof, almost took it as a personal assault that we didn\\'t want wine!\\n\\nI ordered an appetizer and the waiter asked my BF which one he wanted, the waiter said, \"Oh you want to share the appetizer\" I said I assumed it was for 2 people, as most appetizers at almost any place can serve more than one person, and it didn\\'t specify that they were single serve. The waiter was rude, as if I should have already known this information. \\n\\nSo we were brought bread, a variety and this was actually fantastic. I was thinking that my meal would be great and the stuffy atmosphere would be worth it...I was wrong. I had pork shoulder that tasted like Walmart/enhanced meat. It was tough, fatty. Served with puree sweet potato that tasted like baby food. BF had \"seared\" tuna, that was just rubbery, nasty, no flavor. I\\'d give the meal 4/10...no lie a pork dinner from Bob Evans is better. \\n\\nI think this place needs to learn that sometimes less is better. Simple dishes can be better, dont need a thousand ingredients to be good. Overall the the atmosphere is what kills it. Its forced elegance. \\n\\nPass. There are plenty of good places in the Burgh that have excellent food, but are comfortable and laid back, but still elegant.'},\n",

The place has continued to evolve over time but maintained their German slant on beer and food.  I enjoyed a nice cold Hacker Pschorr Munich Gold draft on tap tonight with my fish sandwich and perfectly seasoned potato cake with applesauce.  They feature more than 27 beers on tap which is nice and have a full bar area with high top tables and some games. \\n\\nTheir fish batter is a tad bland but the fish was white, fresh, and meaty so that sort of made up for the batter.  The potato pancakes were exactly like my dear Mother used to make: shredded potatoes with minced onion and egg that is formed into a cake and pan fried on high heat to give the outside that crispy texture and keep the inside moist.  My partner loved the coleslaw too. \\n\\nThe chairs and tables are beautiful rustic wood with a dark stain that must have recently been refinished.  Business was brisk with many casual diners still streaming in as we finished up around 8:45PM.  We love to find places that will accommodate some later dining so this one goes onto the short list of North Hills restaurants with later dinner bells. \\n\\nOur waitress was very attentive and courteous which created a nice dining experience.

Yeah, it's probably not light on calories, but to be honest, that's not really a thought if you opt to go for these. The chocolate chips are warm and well-melted into the actual pancake itself, making for one delicious yummy bite after the next. Their hot cakes are also a nice choice along with the stuffed raspberry French toast, which was oh so good. The raspberry sauce was actually not as tangy as I anticipated ... which is a good thing, considering that it would have been a sore spot (too sour) if it contrasted too much with the sweet consistency of the dish.

It started with the salsa, then the guac, the pico then the rice and beans.  I mean TOTALLY BLAND.  I even got a pineapple margarita lacked flavor.  I thought there was something wrong with me but my friend I was eating with confirmed it. \\n\\nThe salsa was brown and I'd guess was roasted tomato flavor?  I can appreciate a non-traditional salsa, but I dind't taste any seasonings and it didn't have a citric taste like any tomato salsa would normally have.  Next we ordered the tableside guacamole. We are guac finatics, but the pico they added had no citrus zing and it needed salt. They made it tableside, but it was already all in the bowl when she brought it and she just mashed it at the table.  \\n\\nThe pineapple margarita seemed to be made with fresh pineapple juice, which is awesome.  I ordered it blended and it was very watered down. but I dind't think $8 for an Avion margarita was that bad. \\n\\nI had the surf n turf burrito which was loaded with delicious tender steak and big shrimp, both cooked very well.  It was topped with a creamy orange colored sauce that was very tasty...but then they stuffed it with rice that had NO flavor. It looked redish orange, but had literally ZERO flavor. I had to ask the waitress for a salt shaker to even be able to eat it, but it barley helped. \\n\\nMy friend had the grilled mahi mahi tacos which she said were really good.  But she had the same opinion on the rice. It also came with black beans that tasted like boiled, rinsed, dry black beans. No seasonings that we could detect. \\n\\nIn fairness to the restaurant, I did not complain.  When this many things are wrong, you just kind of assume that this is how they make their food and that we just wont go back.  I'm teetering about trying it again because if the food was this bad all the time I dont know how it could still be open.\"},\n",

The Gyro was indeed huge and the meat was flavorful but the veggies were close to the end of their shelf life. The fries that came with the meal were crap actually, I know that they are fresh cuts fries so lets make sure that they are cooked all the way through and have some sort of uniformity in size and the oil that they were fried in was obviously fairly old.

The prime sirloin was smothered with melted bleu cheese and served with a baked potato and vegetable.  He really enjoyed his steak and so did I!  I opted for a single crab cake dinner.  It was served with poblano corn salsa and \"Bugsy\" secret sauce.  For my sides, I got the risotto and green beans.  For $2 extra, I got a salad and BJ got wedding soup.  We both thought our meals were very good.  His steak was perfectly cooked and had a lot of flavor.  His only complaint was temperature of a couple items.  His soup was luke warm and his potato wasn\\'t very hot.  I thought my crab cake wasn\\'t very fat, but still loved it, the seasoning, the sauce.  I am adding it to the list of my favorite crab cakes.  Not the best ever, but great in a different sort of way.  Plus, my meal was almost more than I could eat.  \\n\\nBJ did make mention of his issues with his meal and our server sent a manager out right away.  Our server was really great.  We really like this new joint and look forward to coming back.'},\n",

But the last two times I ordered I requested lite cheese and extra sauce, and it seemed my requests were totally disregarded.        \\n    The second pizza from Ephesus that I ordered about two weeks ago I ordered by phone and when I requested the lite cheese extra sauce the person taking my order seemed disinterested and made me feel rushed to get off the phone. When I picked up the pizza it was the exact opposite that I wanted it. It definitely had extra cheese and very little sauce.\\n   So today I decided to give them one more chance, I figured if I ordered online, at least my special request of lite cheese, extra sauce would be \"written\" down.\\n    So I am sure you all know where this is going!,I picked up the pizza, took it home, and there it was, extra cheese and hardly any sauce at all. My friend with whom I was sharing the pizza described it as \"cheesy bread\" and nothing more. We were in the mood for very good pizza and all we got was \"cheesy bread\\'.\\n    Not everybody likes tons of cheese on their pizzas some people like to relish the flavor of the sauce, which in this case was almost non-existent.

It said the order would be ready in 30 minutes and so I arrived 20 minutes after I ordered it, expecting to wait a few minutes after I found a parking spot (no easy feat on S. Craig St.). When I got inside and told the lady at the counter that I was picking up a takeout order, she said they still had not received it. As I was calling GrubHub customer service, she \"happened\" to find it as I got through to an agent and rushed it to the kitchen. I asked the agent to look into it and admittedly the order failed to be delivered the first two times, whether due to a failing on GrubHub\\'s part or Yuva\\'s part, I do not know. However, it was confirmed that the order had made it through ten minutes earlier.\\n\\nAt long last, when we had our food and made it home, we tried the food and were utterly disappointed. The samosas were poor compared to others I have had, a tough maneuver to pull off given they are usually frozen samosas anyhow. We also had bhaigan bhartha and kofta curry (known at authentic Indian places as malai kofta), both of which were a major disappointment. I have had malai kofta at many different Indian restaurants and this was the least flavorful I have ever experienced. The bhaigan bhartha, on the other hand, was charred so much that the smoke level nearly exceeded every Scotch in existence. We requested that both be made spicy and neither were. I will certainly never be going back. I highly recommend Taj Mahal on McKnight and Taste of India near the Children\\'s Hospital if you want actually good Indian food.'},\n",

I\\'d never been to Hop Farm before, but I was excited to check it out. \\n\\nThe tap room is very cozy, with some rustic decor and a smallish bar. We ordered some beers while we decided on what snacks to get. The variety of beers to choose from was pretty good, and they had a selection from Arsenal and Apis on tap too for non-beer drinkers. I liked my beer but I didn\\'t love it. I would have had another if we had time to stick around, but I wasn\\'t crazy about it.\\n\\nWe decided on a homemade pretzel and an order of mac and cheese. I was absolutely floored with how delicious the food was! The pretzel was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside as it should be. The mac and cheese came with a homemade focaccia which was SO flavorful. I think it have as rosemary and it paired really well with the gouda in the mac. We also thoroughly enjoyed dipping the pretzel in the cheese sauce. YUM!\\n\\nThe menu is small, but I\\'m fine with that because they seem to do it all very well. I REALLY want to try the nachos next time. We saw two orders come out while we were there and they looked amazing.\\n\\nI\\'ll definitely be back to try some other food and beers.

I love the décor when we walked in..  rustic and typical bbq joint - but cool at the same time.  Spacious - and nice lighting.  We were seated promptly at a booth in the front of the restaurant.  It was fun to people watch - the comings and goings on Carson.  The menu was short and simple..  2 sides if you were to get Ribs or Pulled Pork. ..nice.  My nephew ordered the half rack of ribs and mac and cheese and waffle fries.    I had to taste the ribs.. they were good but more fat than meat for sure.   That\\'s the chance you take with ordering ribs.  Some have more meat than others.  There was bbq sauce on the table -which was nice but not several different flavors like some bbq establishments.  \\n\\nI ordered the buffalo blue burger.. think it was called that.  It was probably one of the best burgers I have ever had.   Bursting with flavor.. my taste buds were singing and no doubt that burger was a \\'life changer\" (my reference to anything that blows my mind).  We ordered the Cajun - wet style wings for an appetizer and they were dam good - super flavorful.  The service was great.  I checked out the ladies room (but of course) and the décor is so cute..  and was clean.  Prices not bad - typical.   Our meal came to about $40.00 which was standard.   I noticed there was a dj stand too..  cant wait to go back for that some evening!   \\n\\nPuzzling I went to the website twelvepgh.com to share some menu items with some friends- as I was raving about the restaurant and to see if events are posted etc.  The website is under construction? I thought this establishment was open for a while - having a current update to date website is pretty important I would think.  That was a little disappointing. Well at least the website list the hours. Thank goodness for the beloved YELP providing information to the community and the best way possible! \\n\\nThank you ...I will no doubt be back.'},\n",

After many meals with lots of different people in groups ranging between four and 14, the food always rocks and the service is always flawless.\\n\\nThe menu is has some great starters. My favorites include the crab balls, Buffalo chicken balls and the rocket salad. The entrees are all meatballs, which seems improbable, but with the three step fun process  -- pick your ball, pick your sauce and pick your preparation (and perhaps a side), the possibilities are endless and it never gets old. I'm a fan of keeping it simple with the saucy balls. Servers can often suggest some winning combinations with particular sauces and sides. There's an extensive craft beer selection that's heavy on local brews, some good cocktails and an adequate selection of wines.\\n\\nService is always on-point. I have to give the restaurant props for the ease with which they handle large tables. On at least two occasions I've had over a dozen people at a single table. Not only does the staff nail it by getting orders correct and having courses arrive at once, but upon request they cheerfully provide separate checks (yes, even for 12 persons!) and they make it look easy. I can think of a lot of restaurants that could learn a thing or two from the customer service that Emporio provides.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is fun and lively with a good soundtrack. Big windows at the front open to the sidewalk when the weather is nice. There are high-top tables in the bar available too.\\n\\nThere's no reservations,but it's a sizeable place and tables are always turning over. Plus, they use the No Wait smartphone app very effectively and the bar area is an inviting place to wait, as is Il Tetto, the third floor rooftop bar worthy of its own praise (as is Mezzo, the second floor restaurant).\\n\\nFor those unfamiliar with downtown Pittsburgh, it's worth nothing that the restaurant is very close to the convention center, Westin Hotel and Courtyard by Marriott and is only a few blocks from the theaters of the cultural district and the bridges that lead to PNC Park and the Warhol Museum.\"},\n",

From the minute you arrive until you leave this place will blow you away.\\n\\nUpon arrival you stop to order at what appears to be the bar area. It's kind of Smallman Galley (ish) where you order and pay at the counter before choosing your own seat with a table number. You can review the menu before arriving, but honestly the hostess did such a fabulous job explaining everything just go with it. The line never went down and even with people breathing down our backs to order the hostess never made us feel rushed. She was so sweet and took care in making recommendations and explaining our best choices to cater to my nut allergy. \\n\\nPer the recommendations we ordered three items: Boczniaki z kapusta, the Perogi and the Kluski Slaskie. We also each had a drink. Marissa had the Becherovka, house tonic & burnt lemon and I had the Fernet, scotch, apple cider. I took one look at the drink menu and had no idea what to order so I let the staff pick for me! I am in no way a scotch drinker, but I loved this drink! I was still skeptical when it arrived at the table I wasn't sure what to expect. It was incredible. One of my favorite drinks in Pittsburgh. Go out on a limb and try it! \\n\\nWe waited no time at all for our order. I'd be surprised to say it took even 15 minutes. The dishes are presented beautifully. We split all three items and it was a perfect amount for the two of us. The Boczniaki z kapusta was by far my favorite dish. The mushrooms are roasted perfectly and the butternut sauce tops if off. The Klushi Slaskie dumplings are a bit flavorless on their own. With the help of the sauce they are magical. \\n\\nIf you are planning your visit be sure to ask for recommendations. The staff is super knowledgeable and kind. You will not be disappointed.\"},\n",

We usually go to South Side Barbecue or Pork n' Beans but figured we would switch it up for a change. The service was good and we both ordered the combination platter that had brisket, pulled pork and ribs. It also came with two sides. I ordered the mac n' cheese along with the baked beans. The food was really tasty and the sauce was nice and peppery. I do wish they had a variety of sauces though. My sides were ok but not amazing. I was sad about the mac because I thought it was overcooked and not super flavorful. Even the best mac n' cheese can be ruined by overcooked noodles so it's even worse when the mac isn't the greatest to begin with. Overall, the food was pretty good but I don't think I would choose Twelve over other options in the area.\"},\n",

The staff member gave us all a menu and mentioned a discount we could use for the day, so my coworkers and I figured we\\'d give them a try. And...I was pretty underwhelmed. \\n\\nFor starters, a couple people definitely had problems ordering due to a poor connection or something like that. Fine. It happens. But then when our food eventually arrived the poor deliveryman told me that he had no idea how much my lunch cost. Fortunately, I\\'d gotten that info when I ordered. But what in the world did he plan on doing if I hadn\\'t calculated my payment in advance? Would I have had to call in to sort out their staff\\'s mistake? Would I have just handed the guy a random amount of money and waved him off? I have no idea.\\n\\nAnd the food itself certainly left a lot to be desired. I had ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer, but they did not impress me. The cheese was anything but gooey, and I ended up eating a couple sticks in one bite because the cheese simply wouldn\\'t rip apart when I bit into it. The batter on the sticks also left a pretty bad aftertaste in my mouth, so much so that I chugged Coke after every bite to try to make up for it. \\n\\nAs for the sandwiches, my coworkers complained that their hoagies all came with too much mayo - one girl had even asked for her mayo to come on the side. No such luck: it came on her sandwich just like everyone else. As for me, the ranch I had asked to go with my buffalo chicken hoagie didn\\'t even arrive. I used some from the company fridge. And the ranch was the only way I could eat the sandwich, which was drowning in buffalo sauce and could have been taken out of their toaster a lot sooner - entire sections of my sandwich\\'s bread shouldn\\'t break off when I bite into it, but that\\'s what happens when you over toast something so badly...and is what happened here.\\n\\nI currently don\\'t plan on ordering from this place again.

       "  'text': 'My wife and I had dinner on a Saturday night (3/19/11) at Spoon in East Liberty. Based on other Yelp reviews and the recommendations we received from friends, we expected quite a lot from Spoon. (We are in the process of moving to Pittsburgh, so new to the dining scene in the \\'burgh.)\\n\\nOur expectations were, sadly, not met by Spoon. Maybe it was a bad night and just bad luck for us, so I\\'d be willing to give it a go again in the future.\\n\\nSo, what wasn\\'t up to scratch? For starters, the service was not good enough. We arrived and a group of three old ladies (i.e., easily well into their 70s--one was with a walking frame!) were trying to get out the door. They, of course, were having some trouble with the (heavy) doors and the step down to the sidewalk. Between the two valet guys and two hostesses standing around, there were four restaurant staff who did NOT help these nice ladies. My wife and I instead did the good deed of helping them outside to their waiting car. Not a good sign of the restaurant\\'s respect for their customers. After being seated the first interaction with our server was \"Do you know what cocktail you want?\" No \"hi, welcome to Spoon\" or \"how are you tonight?\" We had just sat down so asked for more time and he just walked off. His gruffness continued, though was markedly toned down to a more acceptable human level by night\\'s end.\\n\\nThe food. Other reviewers have raved about the food. I\\'ve had better elsewhere. In Pittsburgh my experience is limited, but I\\'ve had fantastic dinners at places like Salt of the Earth and Tamari. I hoped Spoon was in the same league...that remains to be seen. Compared to some decent neighborhood places in NYC, Spoon just didn\\'t stand out. It was above-average for sure in the food department, but there were too many misses, not enough hits, and some ill-conceived dishes. Perhaps we just chose wrongly and had some bad luck. Who knows?\\n\\nFor appetizers, we had the enchiladas stuffed with some seafood (swordfish I think, but it was tasteless), and the shrimp and grits. The enchiladas were nothing special. The pineapple salsa was the only piece of flavor on the dish. The shrimp and grits was better, but nothing spectacular. It was a good quality southern version of mushroom risotto, with a gratuitous jumbo shrimp on top. The shrimp was overcooked and a bit rubbery. What a shame.\\n\\nFor entrees, we had the cod and the \"surf and turf\" (NY strip and Maryland crab cake). The cod--my wife\\'s choice--was very good. The NY strip was done just fine, but the crab cake was dry and the only flavor came from the standard crab cake sauce on top of it. Our problem with these dishes was that they were a bit too \"busy\"--there was too much going on. For example, the NY strip and crab cake was served with a potato cake and creamed spinach and a caramelized pearl onion. The crab cake was totally unnecessary in this dish.\\n\\nWe skipped dessert because nothing sounded all that exciting to us.\\n\\nOverall, for the two of us the total (with standard tip) was about $150 (including two glasses of wine and one cocktail). This seemed too pricey for what we got. \\n\\nOverall, I think this restaurant definitely has a good team in the kitchen and they are turning out dishes with quality, local ingredients--and that\\'s a good thing. But things were too complicated in the dishes and this detracted from the overall taste of the dishes. A general problem with the food was that the main flavors came more from sauces and garnishes than the proteins themselves. Particularly in seafood-focused dishes. That\\'s a pity.\\n\\nWill we go back? Sure, we\\'ll try Spoon again. Is this a \"hot\" and \"must do\" restaurant in Pittsburgh? Not necessarily; certainly not in my opinion at the moment. It did seem very popular with more elderly clientele, though.'},\n",

I had been there before but my friend had not. I showed her the ordering tablets and she pulled off a page to fill out what she wanted. With your burger or dog you can get a side and drink for $3.50 extra. We both ordered hamburgers and fries but our hamburger toppings were completely different.  I ordered Bleu Cheese dressing, Bleu Cheese crumbles, pickles, and lettuce. All on a pretzel bun. My friend picked honey mustard, mayo, American cheese, and mushrooms. All on a white bun. \\nYou have a choice of hamburger, bison, or chicken. We both chose regular hamburger. You can choose from 4 or 8 oz burger. We both ordered 4. \\nOur burgers came to our table pretty quickly.   The burgers and fries were hot.  I felt like the pretzel bun overwhelmed my burger. I don't think I would order it again. The 4oz burger was small. I wish they offered a 6 oz burger. The burger was drowning in blue cheese dressing but had hardly any lettuce. I had asked for it to be cooked medium and it was. I ended up taking the top of the bun off an folding the bottom bun over the burger. That helped. \\nThe manager came by twice to see if we needed anything. I thought that was nice-especially since they were packed. I started to get very cold and couldn't figure out why . . . Until I went to the bathroom and saw that the back door was open. They were bringing in supplies. \\nWhile the food was good I don't see myself rushing to go back.\"},\n",

We got there just as the lunch rush came pouring in, and it got very busy, very quickly for a Monday morning. \\n\\nAnyway, I ordered steak & eggs and my friend ordered eggs benedict, both of which were good for a diner-type place. It seemed to me like they used seasoned salt on the home fries, which I'm not a fan of. Nevertheless, everything was cooked as I asked, and the coffee was really good. There were only a few chairs for waiting customers, so when the lunch crush started it got a little crowded in there. The waitresses were very nice and helpful, although we had to wait a little longer for coffee refills because they had to seat two large groups of people just as our meals were coming out. Overall, Becky's Place has good traditional breakfast food in a comfortable setting. I think if I came back on a day that wasn't so busy, then I'd like it even more.\"},\n",

So, this cant speak to the hibachi tables, but maybe someday it can. \\n\\nArrived at 8pm on Saturday for our reservation, and immediately were seated at a (wobbly) table by the window. We knew we were there for sushi, and we couldn't wait to get to ordering. They have paper sushi menus you can fill out with a little golf pencil and turn in like homework to make your sushi appear. We just kept checking boxes. Haha! So many amazing choices. Thanks to everyone who recommended the Hanalei Roll, it was amazing! \\n\\nSo the order went a little something like this; Spider Roll, Hanalei Roll, Pittsburgh Penguins Roll (much to the disappointment of my date did not contain penguin. KIDDING), Spicy Crab Salad Roll, and the Crunchy Philly Roll. When Leah, our server, brought them out we (and our little wobbly table) were a little overwhelmed. But we made it disappear quite quickly. \\n\\nNeither one of us really liked the Penguins Roll. Seemed like it was just..missing something. The spider roll is forever my go to when trying new sushi. It was great. The Hanalei Roll, as previously stated was incredible. Who knew you could flash fry sushi?! The crunchy Philly Roll was about the same. Really good and disappeared quickly. My amazing date really enjoyed the spicy crab salad roll. Leah recommended it, and it was an excellent choice. \\n\\nEverything was really great. No complaints on service, Leah made sure we had everything we needed quickly, and kept our water glasses full.

Is it because I DON\\'T leer at them? It\\'s sad and patriarchal, but so are they, so I digress...), and flatulent, fatuous \"bros\" as they are commonly referred to (they\\'re real!), I had almost discarded all hope and headed straight towards the trolley stop until I came upon...\\n\\nhttp://www.comicartcollection.com/images/wantlist/sphinx.jpg\\n\\nNo, I didn\\'t encounter a super-villian. What I did encounter was a minor bliss. \\n\\nI know nothing about hookah and have little interest in it, but when I sensed calm as I peeked into SCC and remembered that they do have a menu, I sat down in this carpeted room full of twentysomethings, all of whom were mocking the sounds of a babbling brook as they inhaled fumes from rubber tubes. Videos of gyrating belly dancers played on a television screen while everyone but the owner, my server, and I sat on pillows on the floor. \\n\\nIs there a more peaceful place to simply escape from all the madness in this often raucous part of town?\\n\\nSphinx Cafe\\'s menu doesn\\'t aspire to be \"authentic\" Egyptian (try Isis Cafe in Brookline for truer Egytpo-fare ), offering up a number of Mediterranean, Arabic, and quasi-Mediterranean/Arabic snacks and dishes for those who actually might want to eat instead of smoke...or toke. \\n\\nThe gyro I had came with potato chips and included rich, moist meat, crisp vegetables, and a fine, properly creamy-tangy tzatziki sauce. Although I could have done without being charged $2.50 for a can of ginger ale, the mild gouging affected me little considering my safe, civil, chill surroundings. That I went to a lounge in The South Side and didn\\'t leave wanting to pulverize some greasy-haired mook is enough for me to recommend Sphinx Cafe to those who despise the bar scene and find themselves in the area on one of its worst two nights of the week. Perhaps, I\\'ll cast my allergen-induced respiratory issues into the breeze and sample some hookah during a future visit to see what it\\'s all about.\\n\\nP.S.

Yes, the wait for a table is ridiculously long, but you're typically in for a decent meal...especially when you eventually find those one or two dishes that actually resonate with your own taste buds. Of course, that's not an easy task.\\n\\nIt's a good place to take people because they have something for every taste in their menu, but until you find some go-to choices, you could easily be disappointed, as my wife and I will tell you...it's hardly worth the hour or hour-and-a-half wait, but without the wait, it's a great place for a quick bite.\\n\\nAlso, even when you find your favorite dish, a great meal is never guaranteed. For me, the orange chicken is excellent, but it's a 50-50 toss-up whether or not they'll get my side right. I simply ask for STEAMED carrots, as I can't stand the oily vegetables the meal usually comes with, but I'm often served exactly the side I described disliking upon ordering. Generally, the wait staff that I have is nice about it, and immediately fixes it, but it's still frustrating that they get it wrong so often.\\n\\nKnown for their epic portions, and yummy cheesecake, neither are misleading reputations. Most meals, even in lunch portion, are so gluttonous that you'll likely be taking leftovers with you. Especially at the cost, you're not going to want to just waste your meal.\\n\\nAside from the few issues that I've mentioned, I've had way more positive meals and experiences at Cheesecake Factory than not. They do a surprisingly good job with almost every dish, and considering the numerous cooking styles the chefs are responsible for preparing, that's an impressive feat. It's generally a safe bet for a decent meal. Not to mention, I do like quite a few of their appetizers. The ahi carpaccio, although a little heavy on the sauces, is really good, as are the factory nachos and avocado eggrolls. My other favorite thing is the unsweetened iced green tea. I can drink that all day. \\n\\nRegardless, you're probably only there for dessert anyway, and that's the one area that I've never been disappointed in. Best cheesecake ever? I wouldn't go anywhere near that far, but it's as rich and fulfilling as you'd expect, and should please the majority.\"},\n",

We had The Raw Deal appetizer, and I can't think of a more apt name for a $16 plate of mushy fish that had gone one too many pulses through the food processor. It was almost inedible. After that, we had the duck and meat loaf entrees, which were not terrible in flavor, but were both prepared poorly. The temperatures were off (warm potatoes, hot onion rings, room temperature meatloaf), the duck was medium well (despite ordering mid-rare), and the sides were just off, for lack of a better word. It's possible we caught the kitchen on a bad night, but this was entirely overpriced even if it had been good. We spent nearly $100 for an awful appetizer and two entrees that we barely ate half of, and I'm already regretting the fact that I have leftovers in the fridge. There are much better options in the city, both cheaper and better, and I will not be returning to Avenue B.\"},\n",

The place was nice and clean and i got my food ready to go pretty fast. The gyozas were good, no issues there. I was very excited for the ramen and once i opened the ramen bowl, it looked and smelled delicious. But it needed the ramen broth to complete the dish. Now, i opened the broth container and it just wasn't right. I am not new to ramen flavors. The broth smelled really earthy... which isn't unusual but when i tasted a little, it was pretty bad. It had no flavor... the color was brown and unappealing, the texture was like a latte..... to clarify, it wasn't like old/gone bad...it was just a bad tasting recipe. Heating and mixing with noodles didn't help. I could barely eat less than half and threw the rest. I hope other things on the menu are better. For the price, i wouldn't mind trying something else.

       "  'text': \"I love Savoy. In fact just thinking about Savoy makes my mouth water a little, that's how much I love Savoy.\\n\\nThe first time I sampled some bites from Savoy was at a Yelp event last year; unfortunately it took me quite a long time to make my way back, but I after the meal I had last week I think the wait was worth it. I went here for dinner with a family member on a Wednesday night - as a result the place was pretty quiet when we arrived. After checking our coats (this is more or less mandatory as they don't let you drape them over the chairs) we were seated at one of their comfy downstairs lounge tables, and we explored the menu, ordered, and proceeded to enjoy an excellent meal.\\n\\nFirstly, there was the fresh free bread with oil and balsamic for dipping. I was quite hungry so this was a great start. One note, though - beware the spicy bread! We're pretty sure jalapenos were baked into a couple pieces. Tasty for some, not ideal for people like me though.\\n\\nThen there was the drinks. My dining companion ordered a blackberry Cosmo (made with ingredients like blackberry moonshine - quite a nice touch), and I ordered the Starburst. Both of these drinks were superb; the Cosmo was a first-rate drink and oddly enough, my Starburst did indeed remind me of Starburst candies - but was still muuuuch tastier!\\n\\nAs for the food - just, YUM! My companion ordered tomato soup and a pear salad. The salad was flavorful (though pretty standard in terms of salad ingredients), and the tomato soup was simply amazing - in addition to its freshness and being the perfect thickness it came with grilled cheese sandwich squares instead of croutons. More restaurants need to do this with their tomato soup, it was just so good! As for me, I ordered the 2015 restaurant week special - hen with bacon mac and cheese and a side of kale - and this was simply divine. I have yet to find such tender, juicy and well seasoned chicken in the city, plus the mac and cheese wasn't overly cheesy and had the bacon flavor infused into it. The result was that it wasn't too rich and it went well with my chicken and kale. The entire meal was also served with a side of tomato gravy, which was basically a thicker version of the tomato soup I'd sampled and fallen in love with already. I couldn't have been happier with what I ordered.\\n\\nThe clincher for our excellent meal was the fantastic service we received throughout the night. All in all we thought Savoy had amazing food, fantastic staff and a very chill but warm atmosphere. We would absolutely come back - hopefully my next meal here will involve sampling the amazing looking brunch menu!\"},\n",

The bacon was extremely chewy. \\n\\nFor our mains we shared the aligot potatoes, the french onion soup, and the gnocchi. All were phenomenal. The gnocchi was airy. The potatoes were salty and smooth. The soup was rich and can definitely be eaten as a main dish. \\n\\nWe finished with the souffle which was incredible. It was served with a range of sauces and banana ice cream. We had to order the souffle at the beggining of our meal, without having seen the rest of the desert menu, so I suggest they show the desert menu with the main so customers can see other options/prices before making a decision on the souffle.\\n\\nOur wine was also great, but we aren't super picky about wine!\"},\n",

Maybe 10 tables with 2-4 people in what is now a good size establishment. \\n\\nMy friend and I were seated in the back of the room with the fireplace, right beside a bunch of empty tables and a large hole in the wall with cold air blowing through.  It was chilly outside at the time, too, so it wasn't pleasant.  Why they gave us that particular table, I'll never know.\\n\\nIt took 15 minutes for someone to take a drink order, and it wasn't even the server.  It was a manager.  Our waitress eventually did come around and had zero personality.\\n\\nI ordered the strawberry salad and my friend got the steak salad.  These dishes, at lunch time, took way too long to come out.  We ended up being in a restaurant that was nearly empty at lunch time for over 90 minutes.  Food-wise, the salads were excellent.  The strawberry salad was the best I've ever had.  The candied almonds and dressing were a delicious combination.\\n\\nMy rating is based on how delicious the food was, but the customer service and timing of the food really has to step it up.  Blue Water Tavern, the restaurant that was in the space before, had horrible customer service and timing issues.  It was a little too reminiscent of this previously horrible restaurant, so B&C should be working their tails off trying to change patron's minds about frequenting this area.   I will take my husband back to B&C's, but if the food takes forever to come out when he is there, I can guarantee he won't want to go back.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'Yesterday was the Unblurred or First Fridays on Penn. After watching the weather all day we decided, \"Hooray, no rain\", and made our way out into the neighborhood. After walking up and down Penn Ave and seeing some great art and listening to some music we needed some food. There are not a ton of places to eat up on Penn Ave, but the ones that are there are always so good that it makes it hard to pick one. I for one have never been to Apteka and have been eyeing it up for some time. Since we were close and it was an easy walk I was able to get us to go there. Right when we walked in it was busy, but the server told us the food comes out really fast and the turnover for tables is very fast too. By the time we ordered we already had a table, she was not kidding. We asked her opinions on some of the dishes, just because it was a bit overwhelming to look at the wall menu and then the littler menu by the counter. We finally settled on a small plate, two large ones, and a dessert. Very exciting stuff. The decor is simple and very nice. The tables were close together but the diners are friendly and we even chatted a bit with our neighbors to the right. They were long time Apteka customers and had lots of suggestions for the next time we visited. I like places where you feel that the customer base is so nice that it is easier to sit so close because it is friendly. \\n\\nSmall Plates: \\nBoczniaki z kapusta: oyster mushroom + braised cabbage in beer broth + butternut miso + rye crumb. OK. This was our favorite dish out of all the ones that we tried. My goodness. The butternut miso was fantastic. It was so good that we dipped some pierogies in in, some of our other bread in it, and just scrapped the plate. It was a really nice mix of flavors and blended so well. I would get this again for sure. \\n\\nBig Plates:\\nPierogi: Z kapusta i grzybami / seler z jablkiem i ziemniakami i chrzanem: Sauerkraut + mushroom . Celeriac + apple + potato + horseradish. Honestly, I did not like all of the flavors of the pierogies as much as I expected too. I think that the sauerkraut and mushroom was the only one that I really truly liked. It came with a side of greens, some turnips, and I believe some crushed nuts. The greens were fantastic, the turnips were good, and the pierogies, they were ok. I liked the dough, I liked the presentation, I would have just preferred the one flavor over any of the others. \\n\\nSpecial Sandwich: Veg pate + smoked apple and chilis + red cabbage slaw + salt pickled turnip + savory sauce. This was my dish and I really enjoyed it. I would have liked a bit more of the savory sauce because it was so good! I think that it was the smoked apple, but wowza, what an amazing flavor. Next time I would ask for the sandwich to be cut in half. I had a hard time cutting it and it was a bit bigger so it was easier to handle in two pieces. But because of the fresh bread and only having a butter knife it was a little messy to cut into two. I thought that the veg pate, something that I have never tried or thought about was really great. I was surprised how much I really enjoyed this meal. \\n\\nDessert:\\nTarta jablkowa: Tarta jablkowa z sosem z suszonych owocow. Apple tart + dried fruit compote. Again. YUM. This was a nice end to the meal for sure. The tart was crisp and the fruit on the top was delicious. I enjoyed the little drizzle of fruit something on it too. I would suggest ending the meal with this treat. \\n\\nThe place was beautiful, the service was fast and friendly, and the food was great. I cannot wait to come back. I am so happy to be able to come here on such a fun Friday night. It really made the start of the weekend so much better.'},\n",

When we came across Hookah Bookah, it was the perfect solution. \\n\\nBefore I get into lots of detail, I just want to say the I really enjoyed my time here. This place is wonderful! My friends and I opted to try the mango flavored hookah... Absolutely amazing! So, so worth it! (None of us smoke outside of the occasional hookah.) We also took advantage of the available beverages. I was going to order a mango lasse, but sadly they were out of mango pulp, so I opted for a frozen chai later instead. It was delicious! I could definitely taste all the spices in it! \\n\\nThe whole place was quite relaxing. My friends and I took advantage of the leather seats. I enjoyed how spacious it was. Lots of seating. The large TVs were nice too! The staff were attentive and changed our coals often. \\n\\nOverall, this was a wonderful experience! I can't wait to return soon!!!

A little softer than al dente which was good for manicotti. \\nThe fourth, which was my main entree, was a completely unbelievable polenta!

As a vegan I am always on the lookout for a wonderful vegan experience and this was unfortunately it. Let me break it down for you. \\n\\nUnlike a true upscale restaurant you order as you come in the door. The menu is written on table paper and pinned to the wall. After you order you have to walk around and find an available table. We were fortunate that we found one fairly quickly. \\n\\nMeals: bland. Because I am unfamiliar with the type of food Apteka serves I  ordered the 2nd dish on the large plates and had my partner order the peorogies. I was surprised that my meal was actually a salad. Why would I go to a vegan restaurant to order a salad when I can get that anywhere...this is what my friends said when my order came. The salad was good but not great.  My partner shared his meal with me but the sauce tasted sour so I didn't like it. \\n\\nCons: I don't like ordering my dinner at a counter, grabbing my silverware and finding my own table in this type of restaurant. While the servers, or food runners, were pleasant they did not come back to check on you. \\n\\nPositives: the service and atmosphere. The food came quickly and the atmosphere was great although a little too dark for my liking. \\n\\nI am truly upset that I cannot support my community of vegans but this is not an establishment that I nor my friends would visit again.

Great beer selection; around 10 beers on tap and two walls filled of beer you can sort thru and choose one, take to your table, and a server will come and open your beer and give you a glass.

Based only on beer selection, this is five stars. However on a Saturday night, it closes early at 11pm. Also we had a fruit fly bugging us and we had a hard time slapping it.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"I stopped by here earlier today for lunch with my father and goddaughter.  We had both driven by Valiants many times in the past and for some reason had never gone so I was happy to oblige him whenever he expressed an interest.  Whenever we got there the parking lot was mostly full, both front and back and I think we got the last spot.  We then walked around the restaurant and went in and seated ourselves in a booth.  The inside of Valiants looks like how you would picture an old diner complete with lunch counter, checkboard floors, 50's/60's pictures on the wall (Elvis, Betty boop, Marilyn Monroe and other diners) and interesting colored mint green booths.\\n\\nFor lunch on this day I decided to go with the Valiant burger with a side of fries.  According to the menu, the burger was an 8 oz party with Swiss cheese, grilled peppers, onions and mushrooms.  It ended up taking a pedestrian 30 minutes from ordering until it got to our table which I normally wouldn't mention but with a somewhat fussy 1 year old at our table, it felt longer.  Honestly I wasn't expecting much from it due to its price ( less than $6) and the 2.5 star Yelp rating for Valiants.  So I was pleasantly surprised whenever I bit into the burger and I thought it was actually quite good.  It was larger than I expected as well with ample toppings and a nice layer of Swiss on the top.  The only part that could have used improvement was the bun.  While it was toasted it could have been toasted longer as the bun ended up being soggy and fell apart whenever I ate it.  Their fries were crinkle cut and came out piping hot and tasted pretty good.  When eaten plain they could have used some more salt but whenever I added Franks red hot to them I was happy.\\n\\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Even though our order took a little longer than we hoped, the food was good and the prices are too.\"},\n",

The decor and vibe of the whole place was very sophisticated and pleasing to look at. We waited probably about 45 minutes just for our appetizers to come, and I got the fried mac and cheese bites. They were pretty good, but they were burnt. The bread they served was pretty stale. It felt like an eternity waiting for our main dish. My sister's boyfriend got the wrong meal several times, and my meal (which I believe was a penne four cheese pasta with chicken) was salty, the sauce was horrible and the chicken was pretty soggy. My brother got a burger that was meant to be medium rare and he got well done, as well. The staff treated us like little children. The cheesecake was pretty okay, but it was pretty much the same thing you could get from the grocery store. We got our bill reduced due to mistakes, and it somehow still came out to be about $300. Overall, very mediocre for such a high price.\"},\n",

We love Vocelli Pizza and have been ordering from Moon Vocelli for years anytime we want pizza.  \\n\\nWhen I ordered today, my experience was as good as always.  They informed me they were running behind and that it would be an hour before our pizza would arrive.  We said \"no problem\".   The weather is nice, so we sat outside on our front porch to wait for the order to arrive.  After an hour and a half, we decided to call to see if they would be here soon.\\n\\nA woman rudely interrupted the person who had answered and demanded my phone number and address, and then proceed to tell me I must have given the wrong address and her driver waited for 15 minutes and no one answered the phone (well yes, that\\'s because we were outside on the porch waiting for the delivery).  She then told me to come get my order or she could cancel it.  We opted for the cancel.\\n\\nThe only thing we could figure is the delivery driver must have come to our back door.  Of all the years we\\'ve been ordering from Vocelli, they have ALWAYS delivered to the front door.  Maybe delivery preference should be included with the ordering process.  I would have hoped the driver would have thought to try the front door but I guess that\\'s asking too much of a low paid position. \\n\\nIf our theory is correct, it was a simple misunderstanding, but the woman I talked to was not very pleasant and hence I became not very pleasant in response.

He seemed surprised and his was response was \"oh, there was a misunderstanding, I think it\\'s almost done\". Um, what misunderstanding? We were the only 2 people there. In the duration that we were there ONE person came in to pick up takeout. \\nIn short, don\\'t bother. There are MANY better options for Americanized Chinese in the area.'},\n",

       "  'text': '90 minutes for two cold pizzas.....sorry at this point even a two star review is generous.\\n\\nWhile in town with friends, we wanted an easy meal after running the half marathon earlier in the day.  Consulting Yelp, I saw that this place had good reviews, they delivered and since we were less than a mile from them, we figured we\\'d have the food fairly fast (there were two hungry toddlers and five hungry adults, and we needed food, stat!)\\n\\nUpon calling, we first asked if they delivered to hotels just to be sure.  If they didn\\'t, that would be fine we\\'d call someplace else.  So we ordered our two pizzas and gave them the name and address of the hotel. It is a newish hotel, so I told my buddy to tell them \"It\\'s right by the Consol Energy Center, where the Penguins play\".  I figured that even if they didn\\'t know the hotel or the address, most people in Pittsburgh would know where the Penguins play.  We were concerned when we had to say the name of the hotel four times and as it turned out, we were right to be concerned.\\n\\nAfter an hour with no pizzas, we call and they guy says \"Oh, the delivery guy is on your street right now.  Should be 2 minutes\".  20 minutes later the delivery guy calls and says he\\'s on his way.  We ask if he knows where he\\'s going and he says yes.  10 minutes later he calls again and asks where we are.  When we finally got the pizza, it was not hot.  The cheese had congealed everywhere and it looked like it had been cut by a toddler.  There were so big slices, some little slices...just not the usual uniform slices.\\n\\nI felt bad for the guy because he said his GPS had been stolen that morning, but we tried everything to make sure that the place new we were at the hotel right beside the arena and it still failed.  \\n\\nBetter luck next time.'},\n",

My waitress confirmed the order verbally. I received the regular jumbot instead, but didn't say anything because I was on a tight schedule with a plane to catch.\\n\\nI was disappointed with the lack of flavor/seasoning in my meal. It consisted of scrambled eggs, ham, bell peppers, and some type of cheese (tasted artificial and powder-based). The eggs were wetter than I prefer when I order them scrambled. Maybe they added water? Several pieces of ham I ate were very gristly and inedible. I ate less than half of the meal and left. I wouldn't go back.\"},\n",

The second time I got the wagyu meatloaf that comes topped with crispy fried onions on top of a bed of goat cheese whipped mashed potatoes. Out of this world. We also had the side of honey brussel sprouts which is one of the best things I've ever eaten!! The service is very friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. Never waited too long for anything.

       "  'text': \"Absolute fantastic dinner!! My partner and I came here on a Thursday evening (no trouble getting a reservation online). Even though I don't eat meat (I came here once before when I did used to eat meat and it was divine as well), there were a ton of options on the menu -it did help that I do eat fish though. \\n\\nMy partner and I started off with a tuna dish -poke-like tuna, with peaches, a saffron chili oil, microgreens and wonderful fried shiitake mushrooms. We then ordered the ox-tail (for him), the most recent octopus dish, and championones a la plancha (mushrooms). WOW. The octopus and mushroom dishes were definitely our favorites. The octopus is cooked perfectly and served alongside chickpeas that are pickled and then rolled in (a spice that I cannot remember). Mushrooms were mixed together with an egg yolk -the flavor was definitely a little heavy but insanely delicious, especially when you topped the bread with it. All the dishes (save for the platters) are tapas-sized. We ordered 4 dishes, which was the perfect amount for us to enjoy dinner and still get dessert.\\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the churros and frozen crema catalana. The chocolate/hazelnut sauce that came with the churros was the perfect amount of bitterness (great chocolate). The crema catalana we had was a simple vanilla and maple flavor. Again, delicious, a bit lighter than a creme brulee. Overall, the meal was fantastic. As for the actual setting, the tables are a bit close together and lighting is a bit dim, so it's definitely better for a more intimate dinner. The service was fantastic -Sara(h) recommended us fantastic wines to go along with our dishes.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"I came here several months back for dinner per the recommendation of my dining companion, who lives nearby.  This was my first real experience eating Korean food, so I wasn't sure what to expect.\\n\\nSince I don't eat beef, the bulgogi wasn't an option for me, so I went with the spicy pork.  It came in a bento box with three other side dishes (don't remember exactly what they are/not sure I could identify them due to unfamiliarity with cuisine), plus a bowl of rice.  It was certainly a lot of food--more than I could eat in one sitting--but then again, I would expect as much, given the prices.  While the pork was flavorful, it was a bit spicier than I would have liked.  To be honest, it's difficult for me to judge the flavor of the pork, since I'm unfamiliar with the cuisine, but it was interesting and I enjoyed it, for the most part.  The side dishes that came with it were hit-or-miss for me, with some being very flavorful (pickled veggies) and texturally interesting (noodle-y things), and others less so.  I didn't really feel that the rice added much to the meal.\\n\\nThe atmosphere was interesting.  My dining companion explained to me that it doubles as a karaoke place after 8, hence the K-pop music videos playing on TVs as we ate.  Service was fine--no problems there.  Overall, an interesting experience, and I'd be willing to come back and try it again. 3.5 stars.\"},\n",

Everywhere we went was packed and the wait was long so we settled on having a quick bite at Bar Louie.  HUUUUUGE mistake!  When we walked in we seated ourselves. There were not many people there. The place was an oven.  We waited to order our drinks and those took forever to come out.  Beer was fine, but all of the sodas were watered down.  The waitress said the heat might have melted the ice too quickly and replaced them.  Less ice and the sodas were still watered down.  We placed our food orders.  Half hour later she came back and told someone in our party they were out of nachos for their appetizer.  I went to the restroom  and found the most disgusting toilets.  Rings around the toilet and black crud in 3 of the 4 stalls.  There were holes in the wall and paper everywhere.  When I got back to the table (about 45 minutes after arriving) our food was still not out.  Finally an hour after arriving our food starts to come out.  Half of our party finished eating and the other half still did not have food.  Waitress never came back to bring more beer (in a bar!!).  Three people in our party ordered a Crispy Chicken Melt and the chicken was overcooked on the outside and still FROZEN on the inside.  SERIOUSLY?!?!?!  Several other dishes were brought out cold.  I do not think I have ever had such a bad experience eating out.  To top it off we were billed for the frozen chicken sandwiches.  We spoke to a manager who removed the charges and wound up closing down the kitchen for the night.  Spare yourself, do not go to Bar Louie.'},\n",

It's on the same block as my office so it's a great place for a lunch spot for me and Pittsburgh really needs some good authentic ramen places.  As you walk in the ambiance has the feel or a real authentic japanese ramen place with a ramen bar and some tables to sit at.  The menu has a nice variety of different types of Japanese style ramen, as well as some appetizers like takoyaki.  I had the miso ramen which was quite tasty and flavorful and the egg was perfectly soft boiled.  The pork was delicious and tender. Most of the ramen dishes were about $10.  Unfortunately they don't have a tonkotsu ramen which is my favorite, and so far I haven't been able to find it in Pittsburgh.  The server was very attentive--almost TOO attentive as they seemed to be really trying hard to do a good job since they just opened.  I'll definitely make this a regular lunch spot!\"},\n",

My husband has finished his beer and actually wanted another one but was nowhere to be found. The service was pretty disappointing overall. Another thing that I found disappointing was the small portion size for hibachi. Usually I am used to walking out with left overs for two days from one order of hibachi. The sides were just a small portion of rice, vegetables, and soup and salad, but no lo mein or other hibachi standards.  Not even a small scoop of ice cream at the end.

       "  'text': 'My husband and I went to the Waffle Shop for Sunday Brunch, which is your choice of 7 different types of waffles and nothing else. The whole experience was surreal and then there was the \"reality show\" aspect of it which seemed like the only normal part. \\nThis restaurant is obviously run by people who have no - I mean zero - experience in the restaurant business.  When we walked in we stood in front of the door while the servers sauntered around aimlessly, and the manager sat in the window talking to a friend (truth be told this is a familiar experience on the Pittsburgh Sunday Brunch scene, but still annoying). Finally a server came over to us and said that she would clean a table for us but then wandered off. After standing around for awhile longer our table was finally clean, we sat down we ordered coffee, waffles and OJs and waited some more. As I sat watching our server meander around the shop, she seemed to have no clue what she was doing. It all seemed very odd to me. When our waffles arrived from another server, our coffee and OJ hadn\\'t. Soon after our waitress returned and stated, \"I\\'m sorry, I feel like I abandoned you guys.\" And I couldn\\'t help but agree. Our check was delivered by a third server. The first check we received was over-priced, we soon realized that this wasn\\'t our check. We exchanged this check for our actual check and somehow our waitress had added our two $6.50 waffles, coffees and OJs to $10.70. I actually wondered if this was some part of the reality show experience - how you react when your server is a lost and bewildered individual (I\\'m trying to be kind with my words here). \\nI\\'m guessing the whole experience is significantly more fun when you are drunk in the middle of the night. But, for a Sunday morning, I walked out of the restaurant saying to my husband, \"That was a weird experience!\"'},\n",

       "  'text': \"The Dor-Stop had perfectly fine diner food, but definitely not a frontrunner for breakfast food or diner food in the Pittsburgh area.\\n\\nThe diner was packed on a Saturday morning and we had about a 15 minute wait. The staff was great at expediting the process of greeting customers when they came in and getting them on the waitlist/calling names. The dining area is definitely cramped, but tables/booths were very clean.\\n\\nOur table ordered cinnamon rolls, the jumbot eggs (basically a hash), eggs, bacon, sausage, and several different kinds of pancakes. None of the pancakes were great--they have a very dry and tough exterior and a soft center. The dryness/toughness of the cooked exterior, however, basically demands that you drown them in pancake syrup, but they're already pretty sweet to start with, so it just gets gross. The child at our table did not eat more than two forkfuls of the chocolate-chip pancakes.  The fruit-filled pancakes (apple and banana) had great flavor, but again, they pancake itself just wasn't good. The hash was very dry and didn't have much flavor, in spite of advertising itself as having both hot sausage and jalapenos. Eggs, bacon, and sausage were fine, but definitely nothing special.\\n\\nThe cinnamon roll was delicious--soft and tender even at the edges, gooey, and with strong cinnamon flavor.\\n\\nThe coffee was absolutely terrible, which, well, I mean. We're ok with that. Diner coffee is diner coffee. Always disappointed to see the little individual containers of half-and-half, though.\\n\\nOur server was nice and efficient, but definitely not attentive (offered our only water refill while delivering the check for example). The place was very crowded, so she was definitely busy. \\n\\nIt was fun to visit a new breakfast place and check this one off of our list, but we won't be back.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'If you just want the skinny- Delish!!!! Authentic! Genuine! A wee bit overpriced with the add ons. DO NOT let that deter you. Read on for enjoyment purposes only.\\n\\nOkay- I never write posts, but I feel obligated to do so here. Let me preface by saying I am a FOODIE, I work in the restaurant industry, I live to find great places to eat, and I travel...A LOT.\\nSo today I had to drive up to Pittsburgh for work and ended up landing at the Residence Inn in Oakland, PA, because:\\n A. I waited to long to book at the Hampton, and B. Love the Marriot Rewards points.\\n\\nNeedles to say, I arrived late, tired, and a wee bit dissapointed at my lodging accomodations (the staff makes up for it in friendliness and hospitality).\\n\\n None the less it is time for dinner, and of course the Front Desk is pitching this allegedly \"AMAZING\" italian restaurant (they even had a sign in the lobby)- by the way just accross the street and the ONLY restaurant on the street (and it\\'s not the prettiest of streets mind you). Any of those reading this that travel shares my first thought of \"Danger Danger... Do not eat there!\". \\n\\nBut, all they had downstairs were stoffers mac n\\' cheese, and some chicken chinese stir fry, so I decided to spend some time not catching up on email and take a look at the Zarra\\'s menu online. Once I started reading, the interest of the 2nd generation Italian in me was peaked. \\n\\nSo I gave in and gave them a call. Maybe I got lucky... I don\\'t know, but I got the nicest coolest guy on the other end of the line. It goes like this...\\n\"Zarras , Good Evening?\"\\n\"Hi, what time do you close?\"\\n\"Ahh...we\\'re open and seating, what time do you want to eat?\"\\n\"\"Oh I just got in and am staying at the hotel across the street and was checking.\"\\n\"Oh yeah, come on over, we\\'ll gett you seated\"\\n\"Can I order something to be delivered to?\"\\n\"Sure thing we can do that\"\\n\"Ok great, I\\'ll call you right back\"\\n\\nI was so stoked by the non a-hole response that I normally get, where a restaurant sums me up as the 8:45 pm wishy washy annoying last minute order of the evening, that I called back 5 minutes later to order something (even though I realized at that point I wasn\\'t hungry).\\n\\nI will paraphrase this conversation for those that I have lost, am about to lose, or who are just plain annoyed by my endless diatribe (I can\\'t help it! I dig this place!). A lady answered and asked for my order. I asked her what is good and she knew the menu and started rattling things off.\\n\\nWe landed on the ricotta pasta with meatballs AND sausage (I\\'m italian- if they say they make both from scratch- GAME ON), with a side salad w/homemade balsamic.She told me about all of the desserts they make from scratch and extra tidbits of yumminess, but for once I stuck to my guns.Ironically- this was this biggest mistake of my life. I should have ordered one of everything, charged it to my company account, called in sick the next day, and just nurtured an Italian Indulgence/hangover.\\n\\nI decided to walk accross the street and pick up the food. It is a small place in between what I can only describe as row houses (hey, I\\'m from San Diego and live in DC- give me a break). You walk into this dimly lit but nice and clean front sitting area with a bar. They were folding napkins and closing for the night. I won\\'t go in to detail except to say- Cool, Genuine and Quarky characters. \\n\\nI wanted to sit at the bar and start chatting with everyone working there. A guy in his 30\\'s offered to seat me right away, and then the lady who took my order came over to help me. Everyone was of course Italian and REAL! But the best- an older Gentleman dressed better than any man I\\'ve ever dated (owner?) that told me before the restaurant this place was the Electric Banana (I have not researched that yet- assuming an 80\\'s accident in naming vs what I\\'m thinking). What I got from him, was that he has been the owner since the getgo. I could literally write another 5 pages about just how fun and unique the people are that run this place.\\n\\nI left with my food in tow wishing I could hang out and drink with those guys. Came back to my room and started working, forgetting about my meal. SHAME ON ME! Then it hit me and I started unwrapping the 3-time foil-wrapped container (I\\'m already in love, because red sauce gets everywhere in the bag!). \\n\\nOne sniff and one bite- this is like my grandma\\'s, like mine (because my grandma taught me). Meatballs perfect. Ricotta pasta- not what I expected, but in a good way. It\\'s like a gnocchi, but cut like pasta, but different. I dunno- it\\'s good! Dressing delish, like visiting Long Island family. Sausage, chunky with whole fennel seeds...ding ding ding!\\n\\nI only wish I had tried more there. I ordered the ricotta pasta because many of the other items were a bit steep- my only complaint. But with the quality tasted thus far, I can imagine it is well worth it!\\n\\nNote to self- should I stay at the Residence Inn from now on, just so I can eat here? TO BE CONTINUED...'},\n",

It's the kind of bar where you walk in and get stared at because you're not one of the few people who go there all the time. We tried for burgers one weekend when they were closed and then finally lucked out recently. We call in our order when we get burgers here and take them home to eat. They take about 15-20 minutes to cook and come well packaged in styrofoam containers with little holes to vent out steam so the bun and fires don't get soggy. When the weather is nice, maybe we'll eat on the Park Place Pub deck, since I love eating outside.\\n\\nMy boyfriend got the farmhouse burger and I got the bayou burger. We both ordered them medium and they were cooked perfectly, and super juicy. The farmhouse egg was dripping everywhere and looked delicious. The bayou was really well spiced, but not super spicy, so you could definitely still focus on the burger and other flavors. The buns were great too.\\n\\nTheir fries are pretty good, especially the bacon cheese fries (since our order was to go, they actually kept the cheese and bacon separate for us so nothing would get too soggy...so thoughtful!), but I love their onion rings. They are huge and come with a delicious horseradish dipping sauce. I grew up making onion rings with horseradish dip so the sauce is perfect for me, and is exactly what should be served with all onion rings.\\n\\nI'd really recommend this place. I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it and have been there twice. I sometimes forget about it since it's not a typical restaurant but their burgers are seriously amazing and as much as I love the custom burgers at Burgatory, I think I'd choose here for the best burger in Pittsburgh.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'My boyfriend and I have eaten dinner at Spoon twice now.  We did not enjoy our first dining experience there this past summer...it was expensive, the portions were small, and we did not find out entrees particularly tasty. However, after receiving a gift card to Spoon over the holidays and checking out some of the new, seasonal menu items, we decided to give it another shot.\\n\\nThis time around, we found our experience much more enjoyable.  I started off with a glass of the red sangria, while my boyfriend went with a scotch on the rocks.  My sangria was perfectly sweet and served with a single slice of blood orange.  While sipping our drinks, we dug into the delicious bread basket: biscuits, cornbread, and baguette slices, served warm and with honey butter. Definitely a highlight.\\n\\nWe decided to skip the appetizers and just order entrees.  I went with the vegetarian tasting, which consisted of \"housemade tamale, refried lentils, roasted pepper ragout, tomatillo salsa, and tortilla soup.\"  The soup was probably my favorite part of this dish.  It was smoky, creamy, and garnished with tortilla chips and a bit of broccoli.  The rest of the dish was light and tasty.  Spoon doesn\\'t have many vegetarian options, but I would recommend this entree to any vegetarians who are considering dining here.\\n\\nFinally, we ended the meal with a scoop of bacon ice-cream.  Yes, bacon.  Not something I would normally choose, but my boyfriend was intrigued.  The ice-cream had a sweet maple flavor, to which the bacon pieces added some saltiness and smokiness.  We had a hard time deciding if we enjoyed it or not.  Definitely an interesting flavor combination.\\n\\nOverall, I would say that we enjoyed our most recent experience at Spoon much more than our first visit.  The entrees here seem to be a bit of a hit-or-miss.  I will say that our service was very pleasant, and the bar/lounge area in front of the fireplace seem like a nice place to relax and enjoy a drink.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for other restaurants in the area comparable to Spoon, I would recommend also taking a look at Avenue B, Casbah, Legume, and Dinette.'},\n",

Instead what came out was a very large fish fillet that was breaded very lightly and plenty of delicious fries. The fish was fantastic. It was cooked wonderfully, the breading was crisp and salty, and the fish itself was flaky. It was amazing. \\n\\nThe service was below average. Our waitress came by only twice - to take our order and deliver the check. Someone else delivered the food and as I charged the food to the room I didn't even see who took the bill. Our water glasses and our martini glasses were emptied without anyone offering to refill our water or ask if we wanted another drink. No one else checked on us.

Breakfast platters are available, including a ghost pepper cheese omelet, breakfast burrito and make your own omelet. \\n\\nI went back for lunch and had the best Southwest spicy Black bean burger. All burgers are cooked to order and come with fries or kettle chips. The burger I had was indeed spicy, but not overly so, the slaw that was the topping for this burger mellows it out and adds a wonderful flavor and crunch. A texture often missing from a vegan burger. \\n\\nThere are panini offerings including a Chicken pesto, roast beef and balsamic onion jam, a Cuban Midnight panini, an updated version of the classic Cuban, which looked good. This one is done with ham and turkey in place of pork, Swiss cheese, mustard and pickle and grilled to perfection. The Hog Heaven panini also looked good, uncured smoked ham, bacon, provolone and mozzarella and pressed till the bread was crunchy!\\n\\nThere is a huge grab and go section with premade sandwiches, fresh fruit, yogurt, salads and desserts. \\n\\nMy guess is, the deep fried pretzel is going to be a big seller. Even though it's deep fried, it's not greasy at all. We tried the salted caramel pretzel and it's amazing! The pretzel looks more like a giant garlic stick, about a foot long, skewered and deep fried. What you get is an extra crunchy outside and chewy center. There are many versions of this pretzel including cinnamon and sugar, garlic, and just plain with salt. \\n\\nThe top of the menu says all natural ingredients at an affordable price. The most expensive menu item is $7.25. \\n\\nThe Gateway Clipper Cafe is bright and airy, televisions inside, a patio for the summer months. It's a welcome addition to the chain restaurants that populate Station Square.\"},\n",

We took a seat at the table, the AWESOMEST, super nice, friendly waitress came out with menus and water for us AND the dog...WIN!

       "  'text': \"I have to say that when venturing into the wasteland that is Homestead, one never really knows what one may find. It is great that someone is making an attempt to revive some of the multitude of vacant buildings which are rotting away two blocks from yet another mill-turned-mall. This neighborhood once had a short list of 'must visits'...and then came...the mall. And away went...the must visits. From my point of view, except for the usual strip mall shopping, there are only two 'draws' to the entire neighborhood. The movie theater, and the Carnegie Music Hall. And I really feel that Dorothy 6 will excel...when there's a show at the music hall. OR, in exceedingly rare cases, an intellectual winner at the megaplex movie theater that doesn't appeal to the mindless chain chow masses who only go to watch things blow up..\\n\\nDorothy 6 is a little architectural surprise in a mostly plywood-windowed run down area that USED to be a livable working class neighborhood. Exposed brick, chandeliers...a comfortable and only slightly pretentious bistroid setting. Definitely a bit out of place for the location, but a good start.\\n\\nA friend and I were on a night-out reprieve from a snowed-in week, and decided to try something 'different' that had been raved about by Yelpers.\\n\\nThe food? We had a stuffed meatball appetizer, which were four little meatballs stuffed with cheese and served with a dipping sauce of some sort. The meatballs were very good, and the dipping sauce was not any kind of distraction from the flavor of the meat.\\n\\nEarlier in the day, I'd had a late breakfast with another friend who took me to a place with a Reuben that was reported to be very good, but turned out to be just ok (as usual). And here at D6, there it was on the menu...a Reuben. Well, ok. Try TWO new ones in one day. So I ordered the Reuben with fries, and my friend ordered the Pierogi sampler.\\n\\nThe waiter was very pleasant and attentive in his hipster bearded and over-tatted way, and actually was very nice and efficient. He kept the Diet Coke flowing, which is an awesome thing.\\n\\nSo the food arrived, and the report is in. The pierogi were nicely and obviously home made, with quality ingredient stuffing. She had three flavors to sample. Cheese. beer and bacon, and Jalapeno. I tried a bit of one of the jalapeno, and it was very good. But I believe she had five pierogi for $13? We're not talking cover-the-plate pierogi. We're talking a little smaller than Mrs. T's, but made from scratch. Dough, potato, and just enough of the extra 'ingredient' (jalapeno, bacon, etc.) for a zing. $13 for five? A bit steep. They were very tasty. But not worth an hour of your average Pittsburgh working wage.\\n\\nThe Reuben was a little less in price, even with the fries, but again, failed the NY Reuben test. This and the lunch Reuben were very similar, except this one DID use dark rye, but very light on the meat, which is the reason for a Reuben. The fries were actually not very good at all, and really seemed like frozen pseudo steak fries from the Sysco truck. I didn't eat those.\\n\\nThe place has good service, and a comfortable atmosphere...but as I've said many times before, I go out to eat for...food. I don't eat atmosphere. And no matter how nice the server might be (even IF he slips me his phone number and says 'call me, daddy'), if the food isn't a huge wow, I probably won't be back to 'eat'. That being said, should the Carnegie Music Hall pull in another artist worth venturing into that neighborhood to see, Dorothy 6 certainly is one of the best choices outside of 'the mall', and a much better choice than anything chainey IN the mall.\\n\\nIt was a good place to hang out and talk. A better balance between food and price, and it would be a bigger winner.\"},\n",

My mom thought her dish (the scallops and mung fish) was too salty, but she is particularly sensitive to salt. We were a little disappointed by the dessert portion, particularly of the ginger bread cake with egg nog ice cream. There were two small pieces of cake and one TINY scoop of ice cream. Of course, most American restaurants have ridiculously huge portions of food, and I appreciate when a restaurant gives you a reasonable amount to eat, but if you are excited about one of the desserts, don't plan on sharing!\"},\n",

I like any ambiance that makes it feel like an official date night (even if \"we\\'re\" not calling it that ;). We chose to sit at the bar as the next earliest reservation was for 8.30PM (it was 6PM at the time), which was funny because for the two hours we were there the restaurant stayed half-empty.\\n\\nThe bar is wide enough to accommodate meal-eatin\\' so we were just fine up there. The bartender service started off a tad slow, as in almost non-existent. It seemed like they were both tired, but by the end of the night they had picked it up and were more chatty and aware.\\n\\nWe started off splitting the duck 3 ways. The confit cake was super delicious, the breast lacked any discernable flavor, and the liver mousse was just bad. The grilled peaches paired well with the confit cake, but the balsamic reduction added nothing to anything on the plate. We actually noticed that they seem to like to put purees and reductions with a lot of their dishes where it doesn\\'t fit or make sense. Instead of the balsamic mixing well to enhance the flavor of the item, it just felt like it sat on top and you could distinctly taste balsamic and whatever else you were eating. Just getting the peaches and confit cake would have been ok with us.\\n\\nBread basket, as everyone has noted, was absolutely delicious. Their cornbread is amazingly good as is the honey butter.\\n\\nFor entrees I ordered the chicken two ways since it is what everyone raves about and he got striped bass. Neither dish impressed us much. There was just something lacking about my chicken. Maybe I was expecting too much from it since Eleven has the most amazing roasted chicken in the city (no lie). The walnut stuffed leg and couscous were pretty good, but the breast was bland and the peach puree made no sense. And I have no clue what honey lemon essence they were referring to on the plate. The striped bass was just weird. The foam on top did NOTHING for the dish. On the plus side, the veggies were tasty!\\n\\nIf I had to describe Spoon, it would be that it is a fancy place pretending to serve good food. They have fancy decorations, fancy looking dishes, but it\\'s all surface level. It\\'s not \"bad\" food, per se. It\\'s just not very good for what you are paying.'},\n",

Got what I ordered in a reasonable amount of time and everyone on the crew were if not working, not blatantly goofing off. So added a Star to the rating, even though I'm still kind of leary.\"},\n",

Fortunately, service here is REALLY FAST and our first dish came out within 5 minutes of ordering. We got the braised beef noodle soup, bok choy with oyster sauce, pork soup dumplings, and minced pork noodles (zhajiangmian). Everything was really good. You can choose either thin or thick noodles - we got thin for both and it was pretty good.\\n\\nBeef noodle soup - definitely hits the spot when you're having a craving. Large pieces of beef and good broth (just slightly bland for my taste) I was surprised to see broccoli in my bowl though as I'm more accustomed to bok choy.\\n\\nBok choy - not much to report here. Good serving size and you have the option of either pork or oyster sauce. Server recommends oyster sauce.\\n\\nMinced pork noodles - this was amazing. It reminded me so much of home and the ratio of noodle to toppings was perfect. This is not the sweet kind of bean sauce FYI and make sure you mix this thoroughly! I will definitely order again.\\n\\nSoup dumplings - did not have high expectations for this to be honest but these were actually very good! They're on the smaller side but the peels were thin enough to not be overly chewy and still thick enough that they don't break easily. Comes with the vinegar sauce and optional ginger (I recommend). So good and glad that there's a good soup dumplings place in Pittsburgh!\"},\n",

I know Detroit style pizzas are supposed to be crispy, but we couldn\\'t even bite through this. The bottom of the crust is completely burnt.\\n\\nWe don\\'t usually like to complain, in fact we usually avoid it at all costs, but I thought since we paid $30 for a 6-slice pizza, the owner would want to know if there was an issue with it. So I called and explained to the lady that the pizza was burnt. She apologized and got off the phone and told the owner in the back who sounded annoyed when he said \"tell em\\' to bring it back and we\\'ll make a new one but we\\'ve never had anyone else complain.\" The lady got back on the phone and said we could bring it back and they\\'d make a new one. \\n\\nI politely declined (we had plans and to wait for a new one to be made and go all the way back and take the old pizza... we didn\\'t have time). I explained that I just wanted to give them feedback since we spent so much on the pizza and it was our first time there. She said that she appreciated it but that she wanted to make sure it was clear she was \"trying to work with me.\"\\n\\nShe then said I could keep the pizza and bring it back with me next time to get another one. Sorry... I\\'m not keeping a pizza for weeks or a month to bring it back.\\n\\nWhile they would have made a new pizza for us, I don\\'t feel the customer service here is up to par. If you\\'re going to charge really high prices and act like your pizza is far superior, you should at least act like you actually care about the customer and not just coming across that you tried to work with them. \\n\\nThe chicken bacon ranch pizza wasn\\'t good enough to make up for an owner with a big ego and an attitude problem.

I really wanted to love this place, especially since they do have many traditional dishes on their menu, had great ratings, and were clearly very popular based on how packed it was when we went. Maybe I hyped myself up too much...\\n\\nWent for dinner with a friend on a Friday night, so as expected, it was crowded with group of people waiting to get in. It was a 15 minute wait, not bad. From the moment we sat down, however, they were clearly trying to get us out as quickly as possible so they could get as many customers in as possible. The server came back to our table about 2 minutes after seating us to ask us if we were ready to order. We\\'d barely had time to read the pretty extensive menu, so we asked for a couple more minutes. Server was back in about 2 minutes like clockwork. So we just picked something fast.\\n\\nFood comes out - friend got stir fried rice noodles. Nothing spectacular. I got the beef noodle soup, always the first thing I try at a \"Taiwanese\" place since it\\'s my favorite popular native Taiwanese dish, but one that\\'s difficult to get right. The broth makes or breaks this dish...unfortunately it was very bland. Even asked for extra heat, and it wasn\\'t spicy at all. \\n\\nThe sticky rice appetizer was tasty, and the boba milk tea had good flavor and nice chewy tapioca balls, so there was that.\\n\\nAnyways, maybe only 10 minutes into our food, my friend is eating a bit slowly and has put her utensils down. The server comes up and asks if she would like a box. My friend says \"yeah, eventually,\" and before she can say anymore, the server snatches away her plate.  She brings it back wrapped up, and also brings the check even though I am only halfway through my food and still quite actively eating.  We don\\'t touch the check yet since I\\'m still eating. Server comes back a few minutes later, sees the check is untouched, picks it up and puts it beside my bowl on the other side to kindly remind me its there. Ok, fine...I\\'m not really enjoying my food at this point with someone so intent on getting us to be done and leave, so I get my food boxed up and pay so we can leave.\\n\\nAfter my food is boxed up, I\\'m trying to finish my giant mug of bubble tea as quickly as possible without having to swallow boba balls whole. Another waitress comes over and asks \"are you waiting for something\"? I\\'m just trying to finish my drink, c\\'mon...literally sucking it down as quickly as possible without choking on tapioca.\\n\\nI really don\\'t care if the server is friendly or not...I\\'m there for the food and not smiles and small talk. I get it, weekend nights are busy and there\\'s a wait line and you want to get as many customers in and out as possible. But being made to feel like a huge imposition from the moment we sat down, which made eating very unenjoyable, plus our food just being average, makes me hesitant to come back, even though I\\'d love to explore the menu more.'},\n",

The service was great and there are tons of options to try.  \\n\\nWe had the soup pork buns as an appetizer.  I liked them, but would venture on to something else next time.  The boyfriend had the short ribs with spicy sauce.  I sampled one and gave it the seal of approval.  It was crispy and flavorful and just spicy enough.  He did say that a couple of pieces were spicier than the one I tasted, which he appreciated.   I got the chicken basil.  I actually didn't love this dish, but it was mostly because it was a poor impulse choice given what I was actually in the mood for.  It was a well done dish, though, so I can't blame it for my being unsatisfied.  \\n\\nMy main criticism would be that there are actually too many options.  The menu was 5 or 6 pages long, with just basic descriptions.  I had trouble sifting through it all and I definitely had trouble picturing what some of the options would look like.  Some of that is my own ignorance of the cuisine, but I appreciate a restaurant that attempts to help a girl out.  I don't need a picture menu or anything, but a website with some photos or expanded descriptions would have been helpful. \\n\\nI also didn't know whether they serve alcohol or are BYOB or what.  We had bubble tea and water, but weren't offered anything else.  Again, these are things I would typically look up online before going, but there wasn't any website available that I could find.\"},\n",

When I got home and opened the containers, something smelled odd.  When I started to eat, it tasted just as odd.  As it turns out, what is referred to as 'butter sauce' is a misrepresentation of what it really is-----margarine, which I eliminated from my diet years ago because of the trans fats and the fact that any way you cut it, butter makes for a better product.  Sorry Allison B, ain't no butter here.  Margarine is used as a cost-cutting measure, and it just can't measure up.  I rinsed off the peirogies and browned them in some butter and my own onions.   The haluski got thrown away.  For the prices being charged for these products, the proprietor can well-afford to use butter.\"},\n",

It's a spacious restaurant with two tops and four tops and even a few tables set up for larger parties and family style seating. Standard Italian flare starts things off, a waiter comes to the table and announced all the specials, which on this night they featured a pork loin and a shrimp dish. Neither sounded appealing since I had my heart set on one of their standard dishes, chicken Jolene, this is a huge chicken breast wrapped with eggplant lightly sauteed then finished in the oven. A butter/lemon/garlic sauce finishes this excellent dish. For my pasta course I had vodka sauce over imported penne, which was excellent. My appetizer was a peasant dish called greens and beans. You can't get more Italian than this dish, collards and white beans sauteed in extra virgin olive oil with sausage and garlic and lots of fresh bread to soak up the juices. It's BYOB for wine, bring a good red wine with you. Next time I come I want to try the pasta with bacon and peas, that sounds great.\"},\n",

I thought everything was a cool experience for me because I have honestly never seen anything like this. \\n\\nSince I\\'m not very familiar with Chinese food like this I had a ton of questions on exactly what I was ordering. The waitstaff were very helpful and introduced us to some great eats. We ordered Wood Ears & Sliced Tofu kin appetizer which was very tasty and an ample size for two, keep this in mind when ordering that the noodles and dumplings are very large portion sizes so don\\'t order too many appetizers or you will have to bring home food, we did.\\n\\nAs our main dish we tried the Braised Beef Noodle soup and Dan Dan noodles. The Braised Beef Noodles are in a huge bowl of broth with a ton of noodles. I loved the tenderness and subtle flavoring of the beef that was in the soup. The Dan Dan noodles are \"Dry Noodles,\" but don\\'t let that be misleading you still get a hefty bowl of noodles that are coated in a sauce similar to a peanut sauce with a little bit of kick. \\n\\nI\\'m a big fan of Bubble Tea, and fortunately it is offered here and have to say that your options to customize your Tea to what you like are available. I have actually never had been offered so many options for my bubble tea.\\n\\nOn another note I wasn\\'t sure if they offer forks for us lazy folks, but I suggest taking your time through your meal and sticking to using the chopsticks. I have never  used chopsticks for noodles and it was certainly an experience but fun and made our lunch stretch out a little longer than normal. But if you want a fork I saw some folks using forks on our way out.\\n\\nAnother cool thing is the dudes cranking out in- house noodles and dumplings,it sort of reminds me of making taffy. You should Check it out!'},\n",

Almost all of the fro-yo is organic, and we were also told all of it is gluten-free (one person in our party has a wheat allergy).  There are dispensers on the wall, and you pick a cup and self-service pour what kind(s) of yogurt you want.  Afterwards, you choose your own toppings, and it is weighed and price is by the pound.  I opted to pay $1 extra for a waffle cone in my bowl (money well spent in my opinion).  Everyone in our party really enjoyed their treats, and then the trivia game started, and it was a lot of fun.  Our team came in second place, so we won $15 worth of yogurt gift cards . . . YAY!!!

Having found that our first two restaurant choices were closed, my boyfriend and I headed aimlessly toward the Strip District.  We were both getting pretty hungry and frustrated at this point (our fault...should have used the mobile Yelp app to look up restaurant hours!).  We'd both heard good things about Kaya, so we decided to give it a shot.\\n\\nWe arrived right in time for Happy Hour (5-7pm, Monday thru Friday).  I promptly ordered a pomegranate martini...good flavor, but I found it to be a little weak.  My boyfriend and I were able to grab two seats at the bar, so we decided to order our food there as opposed to waiting 30-45 mins for a table.  I went with the Jamaican Green Curry Vegetables, while my boyfriend ordered the Fish Tacos.  By this time, the Happy Hour crowd had begun to clear out, and our food arrived quickly.\\n\\nI really enjoyed my Jamaican green curry.  It had a much different flavor than the green curry I typically order at Thai restaurants, but was very tasty.  It was served with some fluffy saffron rice.  The bf loved his crispy fish tacos, which was great because the portion size was large.  I tried a bite myself and had a bit of food envy.  Next time!\\n\\nI found Kaya to be my favorite of the Big Burrito restaurants that I've been to.  I can't wait to go back and sample a few more items from the menu.

We got there kind of early on a Saturday night (around 5:30-6), so that might be the window for good service as it was busy but not yet packed.  Our server was great (I forgot to catch her name) - attentive but not overly so.  We sat in the outdoor area and it was cool and breezy (the patio lies between 2 buildings which block the sun so it's not roasting out there) and quiet- they were playing some blues/jazz music which was a good volume so that it wasn't overpowering but you still didn't have to hear other people's conversations. Though the metal chairs out there aren't super comfortable, that would be my only complaint.  \\n\\nWe had the spinach and artichoke bruschetta which was to die for.  It was a really hearty size, but we could have eaten several more plates of it it was so good.  I had the flat iron steak. I asked for it medium and it came out medium and was perfect.  Hubby had the perogies with jalapeño and was happy.  I had a nice glass of house pinot noir, hubby had a beer on tap.  I feel the prices were reasonable - an appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 drinks came to $50 which is not bad for date night.  I would definitely go again next time we're in Homestead.\"},\n",

Many have peanutbuttery goodness.  They also have slushies, soft serve, different flavored dips for your soft serve, off-brand blizzards, milkshakes, sundaes, banana splits, a kids menu, and hot food with basic concession-stand items like hamburgers and hot dogs.  They advertise $1 hot dogs on Tuesday evenings.  They also offer ice cream, popsicle, and ice cream sandwich catering.\\n\\nThere isn't anywhere else to stop like this on this stretch of 910.

So tasty and a perfect start to the night.\\n\\nTejitos - a mojito made with tequila - this is one of my favorite cocktails in Pittsburgh - absolutely delicious. I like mine traditional but last time I was in I tried a mango version, it was pretty damn good too. \\n\\nAnd, unexpectedly, they have the most amazing Bloody Mary's - made with orange juice and Tajin (a new favorite spice of mine) - no horseradish.

Table-side Guacamole, and my new favorite - Queso Fundido - a cheese dip with a kick to eat with your chips. If you are ever there on a night when they are serving mussels, that's a no brainer, also a must get.\\n\\nFor your meal - If you haven't filled up on cheese dip, salsa and guac - then you have an array of options to choose from. I usually go for whatever taco special they have, last time I was there it was a wild mushroom taco, I've also had duck tacos and probably my favorite was a pork belly taco. You are typically served two tacos on your choice of corn or flour tortillas, along with rice and beans. There is a host of other options available as well, from salads to steaks, quesadillas and Azul Soup (which is really more of a delicious chicken stew with tortilla strips, avocados with delicious spices and veggies).\\n\\nUsually pretty busy on weekends for dinner, so if you're coming on a Friday or Saturday,  you may have a short wait. But they have a gorgeous bar, and as mentioned, awesome cocktails so I never mind. As a general rule of thumb, if you're coming with six or more be sure to make a reservation any night, just in case. They also have two private rooms upstairs for parties, which is always a good time. \\n\\nWell worth a trip to the 'burbs for this great find.\"},\n",

It's a mixture of ranch and hot sauce, and it was just as tasty and addicting as its name implies. \\n\\nLastly, my friend ordered the Fuggetta-Bowl-It! This is one of its popular dishes. It's a creamy Parmesan spaghetti with classic beef meatballs in meat sauce and shaved Parmesan on top. I don't think you can ever be disappointed by the classic spaghetti and meatballs. The only thing that I thought was a little off for my taste was that the meatball in this dish tasted much saltier than my meatballs.

The place was pretty hopping so I was able to browse and see what was available while waiting for my number to be called; during the wait I watched fresh muffins, cookies and more being set out for people to buy. So I can definitely testify to just how fresh the goods here are - even one hour before closing they were putting out trays that had just come out of the oven.\\n\\nFair warning, the hardest part about visiting Prantl\\'s is leaving with a reasonable number of goodies. I dare you to try to stop in for \"just one treat.\" They have cupcakes, cakes, \"cups\" (which are basically mini cupcakes with lots of amazing icing and toppings), pastries, muffins, and more, all made in a range of flavors - all fresh, all baked to perfection in my experience.\\n\\nI ended up leaving with 8 cups (2 cookies & creme, 2 almond torte, 2 peanut butter and chocolate, and 2 white chocolate and raspberry) that I\\'ve left in my car so I\\'m not tempted to snack on them all at once.

Based on my one experience, I\\'m going to go easy on the place, because I will give them a second chance. Last week at work, I decided to order out. Two of the ladies at work said that Aiello\\'s was awesome and that, if I was going to call in an order, they would like a grilled chicken salad. They agreed that one salad was big enough for the two of them to share and, honestly, I could probably share, too. I said, their salads cannot be that big, but they insisted. I didn\\'t want a salad, so I went with half a steak hoagie. \\n\\nWhen I called, a man answered, who I later discovered was the owner. This was how our conversation went:\\nAiello\\'s...\\nHi, I\\'d like to place an order to pick up.\\nGo ahead.\\nI\\'d like a grilled chicken salad.\\nWhat else?\\nHalf a steak hoagie.\\nWhat else?\\n\\nAnd so on....I was taken back with how rude this dude was. So, I\\'m given money for the chicken salad and, since I was told the food would be ready in 15 minutes, I headed out. I go in and am surprised to see that they only accept cash. Luckily, I always carry cash on me. The girl who rang me out was friendly and had no problem ringing up the orders separately. The owner comes over with my to go order and I ask if he\\'s the one who answered the phone. He says yes and asks why. I say, no reason. But, truthfully, I wanted to see if it was in fact the owner that was so rude to me on the phone. He goes on to tell me that they are known for their hoagies and the buns are toasted, like really toasted. It\\'s their signature thing, he tells me. Okay, anyone can toast a bun, I think. Anyways, I take the order back to work and pull out the food. I have to admit that, even for a to go order, the chicken salad was absolutely huge, and could probably feed two, maybe three people. I didn\\'t try any, but it looked really good and had tons of toppings. Problem is, it\\'s $11.25. So, what if it\\'s just you ordering or eating? Who wants to pay that much for a salad if you can\\'t split it? Also...they only give you one tiny container of dressing for that big salad. Extra dressing is $.75. \\n\\nMy steak hoagie was indeed really toasted. Too much, in fact. Also, the sauce that the steak was mixed in, was also tossed in with the lettuce, tomato, and onions making everything \"wet\" and kind of soggy. Soggy inside, burnt outside.\\n\\nSome pros: The place was clean and inviting. This area definitely needed a nice little restaurant and it\\'s situated off of the main road (route 130). Also, the waitress / cashier was friendly. Lastly, I\\'ve heard that there pizza is very good, so I will give this place another try, but I\\'m not in any hurry.'},\n",

My husband and I took the boys out after a game of laser tag to feed them at their normal feeding times of every 4 hours. I am not kidding these monsters (boys) eat several meals a day if we let them. \\nThe menu is larger than what I thought and contain things like Devinshire over toast, Pittsburgh best fish sandwich and A few different clubs. We went old school and all ordered different types of sandwiches. One son got the classic cheeseburger and it was freshly made cheeseburger with fresh toppings. Another got the fiesta burger and it was he being high with topping. Another got the Philly cheesesteak and onion rings both were delicious! My husband picked the Rachael and he did not even offer me a bite. From the lack of conversation that happened at the table I would say this place is a winner among all of the men.  I was super pleased with a bill that was just at 40 bucks for five people! So no this place is not hip and the crowd does contain lots of folks over 70 but we will return again because of the value, customer service and the overall down-home feeling.'},\n",

       "  'text': \"Girls' Dinner Club visited for Restaurant Week. This review is strictly based on the $30 restaurant week menu/$15 wine pairing. My opinion on Restaurant Week is that the menus should highlight the skill and direction of the restaurant, which unfortunately I do not think Bistro 19 was effective in doing. Regular menu prices are $19-30 for entrees, $8-15 wines by the glass. They also regularly do special dinners, one of which coming up is a local corn dinner (all dishes made with corn!). \\n\\nService was great - timely, and unobtrusive. Appetizers were the highlight of the meal. I had a watermelon crab gazpacho, that started a little sweet, and finished with a hint of spice. Fresh lump crab and a beautiful deep red color. This is one I will try to reproduce. Entrees were a little blase. Options were a Parm/Panko crusted chicken with whipped potatoes and zucchini salad; or salmon with a lime-caramel glaze, green beans, and a chilled asian noodle salad. The chicken dish was all one color, which to me was generally unappealing - but the crowd seemed to approve. Salmon was dry (although I will admit, I am a salmon elitist and since having it sous vide, salmon will never be the same) and the glaze was non-apparent. The green beans were the best part of the plate. There was a third dish offered; a pasta with alfredo, which no one ordered so I can't comment, but pasta with alfredo is a little 1998.  \\n\\nAt the end of the day, the food was just nothing special. It has good intention, but execution missed the mark. \\n\\nMy inner environmentalist also has a big concern with the sustainability factor here. Bay of Fundy salmon was a highlight on the restaurant week menu. The chef's 'signature' dish is Chilean Sea Bass. Unless the restaurant could ensure they were purchasing MSC-certified fish, I would hesitate to order any seafood here because I do not agree with the philosophy of serving endangered fishes. \\n\\nI like the ambiance; its a cool interior with a nice little bar area - modern, but warm at the same time. Sounds like I need to head back and try this Asian Pear Martini that everyone raves about!\"},\n",

I found that the prepared dishes like the turkey lasagna, chicken in sauce or chicken fettuccine, are all on the salty side so if you are sensitive to that, I recommend getting a steak and asking that they not over salt it.\\nThe biggest complaint I have is that the menu doesn't change. They need a great burger, oysters on the half shell, a steak or chicken salad, a veal chop and maybe something like ahi tuna or fresh wild caught salmon that can be ordered rare.

We picked a scallop app and a butternut squash soup. Both were decently well cooked with nothing notable. I have had similarly tasty soups at Panera. The duck entree we shared was a bit overcooked to medium, not rare as we'd requested.

There are few restaurants like this in Pittsburgh that I choose to not eat in because of how loud they are and this one is the loudest. I suppose noise level is hard to control when the restaurant is a cement block that has metal table and metal seats.

However; we knew about that situation in advance, and actually we didn't have to wait too terribly long for a table).\\n\\nI ordered a vegetarian (three-egg) omelette with egg whites, which came with toast & hash browns - and my husband ordered a vegetarian burrito.  We both ordered coffee, too.  The food was *delicious* & portions were quite sufficient, and the coffee was pretty good (a little too weak, but better than at most diners [and also more expensive, at $1.89]).\\n\\nOur server was *terrific*; she had a great sense of humor (we had a very amusing conversation with her) and she was also very attentive.  The people at the cash register (who also took names for tables) were friendly, too.  Afterwards, I complimented the wife half of the owner couple (who have owned the Dor-Stop for 26 years) and also their daughter & the (three) cooks.  All of them were very friendly and the cooks had a great sense of humor.\\n\\nOur (two) meals cost $22.17 with tax (but before the tip).  The restroom was clean, too.\"},\n",

It\\'s really fresh, hand battered, and you get SO MUCH. He tried the Nashville hot once, and it is no joke. We found it too spicy to actually be enjoyable. \\n\\nIn summary, make a reservation, be cautious of anything advertised as \"spicy\", because they do not mess around with the spices, but otherwise, everything here is SO GOOD.

We were planning to get take out and have a picnic at the concert, but alas, rainy weather struck (surprise, surprise!), so we ended up having dinner here before heading over to Heinz Hall, where the concert had been relocated due to the weather.\\n\\nCM and I ordered a medium Moroccan spiced chicken and plum pizza to share ($14.99), and our friends each ordered pide, with one ordering the Ephesus, and the other ordering the soujcuk ($9.49 each).  Both CM and I enjoyed the complex medley of flavors and textures comprising the chicken/plum pizza, which was complemented by a cup of seemingly homemade ranch sauce served with the pizza.  The plums were dried, and weren't overwhelmingly sweet or fleshy, and lent the perfect hint of sweetness to the savoriness of the chicken and the spicy kick of the sauce.  The sliced nuts (almonds, I believe) were also a nice touch, and the size was more than enough for the two of us.  My only major criticism was that the myriad of toppings made the pizza a bit unwieldy to eat, and often fell off as we ate it.\\n\\nThe pide were rather long and thin in profile, and were each topped by a pepper.  I didn't try the Ephesus version, which is topped with ground beef, due to my aversion for that meat.  I did try a slice of the sojcuk pide, however, which is topped with cheese and Turkish pepperoni.  While the pepperoni were different in flavor than traditional pepperoni, the overall effect was reminiscent of eating traditional pizza that just happens to be long and thin.  I didn't try the greens that came with the pide, but they seemed similar to those used to top the chicken/plum pizza, and our friends weren't fans of the sauce, which they found rather oily and flavorless.  However, I did try the tzatziki sauce served with their pide, which was thick and had a great cucumber-yogurt zip.\\n\\nOne important thing to note is that Ephesus seems to have relocated since several of the previous reviews were written--they are now located at street level on 4th Ave., and the space is actually rather nicely decorated for a pizza parlor.  Having said that, judging from the amount of phone calls and runs of the delivery guy, the majority of their business still seems to consist of delivery.  Overall, we were pleased with our experience, and would return to try some of their other offerings.\"},\n",

The wonton noodle soup was a huge disappointment. I'm a serious connoisseur of this of wonton noodle soup, it's a go to staple in my life.

My go-to\\'s at Emporio are the poutine and \"Saucy Balls\" with chicken meatballs, crack sauce, and mac & cheese. If you\\'re still reading, you deserve to know the best kept secret about Sienna Mercato: their RICOTTA DOUGHNUTS.

       "  'text': \"DO NOT go on a day when their Groupon expires...!\\n\\nYes, we purchase Groupons and yes, they have introduced us to some very good restaurants very close to home that we never noticed before... Pi Coal Fired wasn't one of them.  \\n\\nWe had purchased a Groupon many months ago and saw that it was expiring on Tuesday so we headed over for dinner.  The place was full and we were greeted by what later turned out to be one of the owners.  She took our name and the names of several other groups behind us, telling us 'It could be awhile...' then wandered away.  Listening to other diners' chat told us that most of the restaurant must have been there to use their Groupons too.  \\n\\nWe stepped up to the bar and were greeted by a very ignorant waitress who didn't like the fact that I was asking her about her light beer draft selections.  Settling on a Coors Light bottle and a Yuengling draft, she told us that it would be $7.  I paid, we drank and waited.   \\n\\nThere must not be an assigned 'busboy' here because tables were sitting dirty without anyone around while we stood at teh bar wondering if we should bus them ourselves.  The owner kept coming over, letting us know it would be soon, but not heading over to bus the table.  If this was my restaurant- I would be doing everything in my power to get people seated, served and on their way.  But no, she kept saying, 'I'll get someone on that'...\\n\\nFinally seated we ordered right away, knowing that it could 'take a while'.  We then noticed the sign outside saying that between 6-10pm Yuengling drafts were $2.  Was my bottle $5?  We asked the waited and were informed that we were overcharged by 'miss attitude' at the bar.  But, he didn't offer to reimburse us.  All the while, as we observed, people were finishing up and ready to leave and there was no-one to get their check.  Miss attitude was no where to be found.  I'm surprised the one table waited around as long as they did because we would have left.  \\n\\nOur paninni arrived and it looked boring.  Plain looking sandwich, no garnish, handful of Ruffles Ridges tossed onto the plate.  5 minutes go by and the owner comes over to check on us.  'Do you folks need anything?' she asks.  I tell her that 'My Calzone would be nice'.  She tells me that calzones take a while and it'll be out shortly.  Well, why not hold off on delivering the paninni till ALL the food is ready???  We order another draft.  5 more minutes go by and my calzone arrives.  It looks delicious, melted cheese running out... but not as hot as I would have expected having come right from the oven.  Cutting it, it wasn't steaming and I was able to 'bite right in'.  The sauce that came with it is the blandest pizza sauce I have ever tasted!  It tasted like crushed tomatoes, straight from the can.  Asking our waiter about it, he tells us that that's the way it always is because they put fresh basil, garlic & herbs on the pizza's and not in the sauce, 'It keeps the sauce tasting better' he said.  Well, IT DOES NOTHING FOR THE CALZONE!      \\n\\nI finished half the calzone, my wife was so annoyed at the poor service that she didn't touch the paninni.  We requested the check.  Their was no mention of the overcharge at the bar for the beers and our check showed $11 for the calzone, $11 for the paninni and no charge for the draft.  The menu lists the paninni at $9... so... there's a little creative 'book-keeping' here to skirt the drink tax!  Now, I don't agree with it either but they're not saving me any $ by not paying their fair share!  Total bill is $23.54.  \\n\\nI'll give the calzone an A, the paninni a C, sauce a D and service an F...\\n\\nWe will not be going back here again, Pizza Sola is way better!\"},\n",

One on the facade of the building, and a handing one, in case you are walking down the side of the plaza. In any case, the signs are just an indication of how forgettable this place is.\\n\\nOnce you find it and enter, you will find a dark place with three rows of tables going down the depths of it. It\\'s quite deep, and the restrooms are all the way in the back. When we came there for lunch, there were only two other occupied tables and no one from the staff. After about a minute, someone came in from the back and she motioned us to a table that was right besides a small TV/VCR setup along the back wall. The TV was loud and set to CNN, although that did not really matter. The waitress, brought up some takeout menus for us. There was no explanation of any specials (do they even have any?) or even a real menu. Each lunch special comes with soup and rice, or an egg roll. The overall menu was the absolutely standard menu you find at almost every Chinese restaurant in the country - along with the traditional spelling mistakes!\\n\\nWe ordered the Prawns with Shrimp and the Cashew Chicken as two traditional items that we\\'ve had in many places and could therefore compare to their offerings. We requested Hot and Sour Soup, but had to repeat the request three times before the waitress stopped saying \"Won ton soup?\" It came back from the kitchen very quickly and was lukewarm. Very beefy, but definitely not spicy or sour. We asked for hot chili sauce and this also took several attempts before it was brought. Maybe it\\'s a sign of how rarely they use the condiment, but this stuff was very tame. Even the one of us who does not like spicy food used several heaping tablespoons before it affected the flavor of the dish. The soup did look gorgeous though, and the chopped scallions on top were great.\\n\\nThe same thing happened with our two dishes. They looked beautiful - but were almost completely lacking in and kind of flavor. Much to my surprise, the Cashew Chicken chicken pieces were coated and fried. The predominant vegetable was celery and the sauce can best be described as brown and salty. The prawns and chicken at least had more colorful vegetables, but there were only two small chunks of chicken breast and the sauce can only be described as brown and salty. In other words, the flavor was simply not there.\\n\\nThe rice options we were given included steamed or fried. When asked about Brown rice, we got an emphatic shake of the head: \"No\".\\n\\nThe meal was inexpensive, but that\\'s the best thing I can say about it.'},\n",

With each floor having their own personality and menu, it\\'s easy to see why this place is attractive to diners and night-lifers alike.

The bartenders were friendly and helpful as I navigated their gin offerings.  They shook a good martini---win!  The meatballs we tasted were flavorful and portioned well. Coming from a family of amazing meatball-makers and being a pretty good meatball maker myself, this is a good review!   The 2nd floor was also inviting but felt a little more \"restauranty\" to us---which is not a bad thing (but it\\'s the best way I could describe it).  We decided on the Margherita pizza and the butcher\\'s board and a lovely red wine (recommended by our wait person).  Although we could have made more adventuresome picks, we really enjoyed the simplicity and freshness of the meal.  Floor 3-- Il Tetto--was actually my personal favorite spot.  It\\'s fun and eclectic and highlights the city in a different way than many other night spots and restaurants.

       "  'text': \"I have lived on Pittsburgh's North Side for quite some time, and have found myself passing lindos' on many occasions, so today I decided to not drive pass, and stop in. I was not disappointed. The interior is bright and quaint and everything seemed clean. It looks small from the outside, however it is more spacious than you think inside. Based on reviews from other Yelper's I had the sampler. Two eggs over easy, three pancakes, hash browns, and linked sausage. The meal was quite good. The pancakes fluffy AND golden brown. The eggs just runny enough, YES and the hash browns crispy and delicious. The only downfall (if you can call it that) is that they didn't give you/me enough hash browns. \\n\\n\\nNow here is where this story tanks. My server was a young lady with glasses and she was very INattentive. I need a refill on my drink and I had to walk up to the cash register to ask for a refill. She (my waitress) was so busy talking to customers about her recent cruise that she forgot I was there. I saw her at my table two times when she took my order and when she brought my meal. I quests I made the mistake of coming in around 11:30 and my order took a little longer than I expected (do in large part to the amount of take out orders that the kitchen was preparing), I was in there and seated by 11:15 and did not receive my meal until 11:51 WOWSER!!! While I waited I had the pleasure of watching the north side go by. \\n\\nIf you have a chance to stop in, get a window seat (number 9 or 4), relax, and enjoy a good hot meal. Make sure you have the time to wait. I hear they have a breakfast buffet on Saturday and Sunday. I may go back this weekend (or next) and see if today was a fluke or business as usual.\"},\n",

Overall the experience was fine, but not particularly outstanding in any way. The ambiance and decorations were about par for the price range. Food was good, but was quite fussy and had somewhat muddled flavor profiles. \\n\\nWe started with scallops with foie gras and seared baby octopus. The scallops were completely overwhelmed by the foie gras. The octopus was unexciting, though well cooked. The bread basket that everyone was raving about was nice, but nothing that I would write home about. The entrees were a pan seared fish and a pork belly. Both were fine, but continued the theme of contrasting textures and flavors that didn't work well on the same plate. We passed on dessert.\\n\\nWine list was again adequate, and they are able to source beers from sister restaurant BRGR next door. Service was prompt and attentive. \\n\\nOverall impression was a fine dining establishment that had the usual bells and whistles, but fell short in execution. Feels like the kitchen is trying to put too much on one plate, and ended with a confused experience for the diner.\\n\\nAfter reading some of the other reviews, I must say that the comparsions to top restaurants in other major cities are misplaced. It's a nice place, but would not get a blip in places like NYC or bay area.\"},\n",

WE\\'RE A FEW MILES FROM CANONSBURG!\" she screamed as we passed such stalwarts of this suburb\\'s dining scene as Dorido\\'s, Gil\\'s Cafe, and the South Hills Clubhouse. \\n\\nDr. Auslander, our chiropractor, is to blame. The man (his folks own Weiner World!) has become a fan of my reviews after he found my write-up on his practice recently and mentioned to me that a new burger joint had opened in our sector of the metropolitan area. With burgers always on my brain, I convinced Kay to drive and drive and drive...\\n\\nBnDz sits in a typical suburban shopping complex near a trolley stop. Its exterior recalls Chipotle while its interiors and overall business model falls somewhere between Burgatory, D\\'s Six Pax and Dogs, and Five Guys. \\n\\nTable service only occurs after patrons place their orders up at the register. Standard builds like the Chicago Dog or the BBQ Bacon \\'n Buffalo Burger are there for the indecisive, but for the mad scientists there are the \"Create Your Own Masterpiece\" menu sheets on which patrons can check off the boxes and turn them in to an employee. Once that\\'s done, one can pour a soft drink from the self-serve soda fountain, find an open table, and wait to be served. \\n\\nThe cooking action happens in front of the counter in full view, which is where I wish I could have sat. A metal grill steams and flames while fresh, red, red, kroovy ground meat slaps the hot steel. Oil bubbles and growls once freshly cut fries are dropped into it. Drama unfolds once large takeout requests are phoned in. \\n\\nI decided to make my own monster using paper and pen: 8 ounces of Bison (!) cooked medium-rare (there is no other degree to cook a burger) dusted with garlic and sweet onion powder (yes, they do rubs), American cheese, chipotle aioli, leaf lettuce, tomato, red onion, bacon, and avocado on a white bun. \\n\\nThis brings me to one minor complaint.\\n\\nMy avocado was forgotten. \\n\\nThe cashier/hostess will punch in your order as she looks at your specification sheet, which leaves a bit of room for human error. Might I suggest an automated scanner of some kind of like the machines that electronically grade standardized tests? That or the sheets could be have a carbon copy on the bottom so a hungry bugger like me can verify his order. \\n\\nAnother thing to kvetch about: The (vinaigrette) cole slaw was a dud. I sampled Kay\\'s and all I tasted was black pepper and dry cabbage.\\n\\nAll of that was dismissed, however, once our burgers, dogs, and fries came to us in red plastic baskets via the jolly, beaming owner who seemed to know that we had ordered well. \\n\\nThat bison patty was literally bleeding, and when I sank my canines into the burger, all I saw was crimson, sweet crimson -- a literally sweet crimson. I thought to myself, \"God, how could such a massive, fierce beast taste so delicate and candy-like?\" the squishy roll and saccharine fixings making it akin to cake, the blanket of exquisitely melted canary-colored cheese nearly dripping like a yellow ganache. \\n\\nA frank was also customized with honey mustard, onions, and a pickle spear after requesting it be deep-fried, filled with cheddar (a semi-dangerous dog) and placed within a poppyseed bun, my culinary cunning proving brilliant upon first bite. \\n\\nThe Mound \\'O Friez were shared by Kay and I, and Jesus, would Guy Fieri go berserk over this creation.\\n\\nImagine if you will oh jaded eater some immaculately twice-cooked and properly seasoned \"O\"-worthy french fries topped with bacon bits, cheddar, AND good, simple, venerable, scratch-made Mac \\'n Cheese. \\n\\nImagine further. Imagine a real, al dente macaroni topped with a sharply flavorful bechamel sauce. If this was Cheez Whiz, I\\'ll be stunned \\'cause they did somethin\\' to it! The frites had that crisp-vs-fluffy quality we all want in our gold tater shards, the bacon adding fatty/briny goodness and chewy texture while the liquid cheddar rained orange, creamy luxury over the entire debauched party. \\n\\nBnDz also offers desserts, but Kay wanted to have some ice cream, and the nearest place was Bruster\\'s, putting us onto Library Road for the journey home.\\n\\nEpilogue: As Kay drove up Washington Road with some out-of-towner friends of ours to the Mount Lebanon Primanti Brothers this evening, she noticed a familiar sight.\\n\\n\"Darren! Look!\" she called out.\\n\\nThere is now a BnDz  only minutes from us in Mount Lebanon. \\n\\nIt did mention franchise opportunities on their website.\\n\\nThe lady was not pleased with me for causing Friday night\\'s unnecessary mileage. I still say it was worth the excursion, though. Ha. \\n\\nP.S. My mother makes an amazing cole slaw when she feels like doing so. Doug Baros should get in touch with her.

Also was served with potatoes that were just diced up potatoes and no sauce or anything. Very bland. The service wasn't good either. Took them almost an hour and a half to bring out our food. Had to remind server to bring our side of brussel sprouts Which turned out raw and hard. Couldn't even eat them. We weren't drinking byob so every minute was torture. Wouldn't go back... \\nThey are really good at wording the menu to sound like their food is unique and something you'll never find anywhere else. Such a let down when you actually taste it. Bland and unimpressive\"},\n",

I\\'m not going to diss Nakama, because I actually really like Nakama. I\\'ve gone here on many different occasions: for family and friend gatherings, work-related lunches, or just for drinks. This was where I first learned how to properly use chopsticks. It definitely gets a lot of hype, and sometimes you can\\'t even get a seat, but that\\'s because the hibachi is so damn good. They have this creamy sauce that is out of this world, I know several people who order extra just to take home. The whole experience is nice, really. The sushi is better than average and the hibachi is great, too, but I usually go with anything \"surf n\\' surf\" (all seafood). The scallops are some of the best around, but a bit on the small side, if I remember correctly. Very good with the cream sauce I mentioned. Don\\'t know what it is, but there\\'s a reason why they keep it a secret. The service is a number one priority, at least from my experiences. \\nDon\\'t go for the hibachi if you\\'re not in the mood to sit with other people, unless you have a large group. I took my folks once, and I don\\'t think they were totally into it, but it\\'s nice for younger people or a party.'},\n",

Until a Popeyes opens on Golden Mile Highway (which I would totally frequent), I have to rely on this out of the way location for my Southern fried chicken fix. \\n\\nThe first time I had Popeyes, it was in an airport and the chicken was seasoned, crispy, light and superb. This location of Popeyes is extra greasy and heavy. The service though, is inexcusable. The workers here don't greet you, smile or respond well to any questions. I've been here twice and my orders were wrong both times. They missed my side last time and a biscuit this time. When you tell them to correct this, I was given major attitude and no correction. Also, can people working here go through training to entering coupons? It is not very difficult and absolutely does not take 10 minutes. \\n\\nMy last complaint is about their iced tea. It's hard to mess up iced tea but their version is so heavily sugared and congested with syrup, I had to choke back a gag because of the artificial sweetness.\"},\n",

The crispy sea bass was anything but, as it was laying in a pile of broth which made it soggy and chewy (among the pile of tartar sauce (who puts tartar on sea bass!?!) that was laying on top). \\n\\nOverall the plate was way too busy and overcrowded The dishes also had so much going on the plate that the flavors didn't melt together at all, everything besides the kitchen sink was put on the plate. The saddest part was that our server never came over (in fact we barely saw him the rest of the evening after he took our order) to even ask how it was!\\n\\nWe were so turned off we asked for the check and opted to head out somewhere else for desert.\"},\n",

It was a great day and we got a nice table at their covered outdoor area. The margaritas on special were good.. came in a plastic cup though. The guac is made right at your table. Some find that really cool, I find it gimmicky. The guac is nothing fancy, just your regular guac ingredients, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, jalapeños and lime but yummy! I also ordered the veggie stuffed peppers and a veggie empanada both of which were excellent. The stuffed pepper appetizer is highly recommended! We ended with their tequila cake which is a tequila infused tres leche. It tasted like a regular tres leche with no sign of any tequila infusion but tasty nevertheless! For vegetarians especially, La Palapa is one of the better Mexican restaurants in the city and I'll definitely be back here again!\"},\n",
