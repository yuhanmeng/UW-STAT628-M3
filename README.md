# STAT 628 Module 3

## Motivation:

As living standards rise, more and more people choose to eat outside. Then problems will come to us that which restaurant should we choose and how can a restaurant prove its star level? Based on the yelp dataset,our group decided to do some analysis to provide some suggestions for both customers and restaurants. Since there are so many businesses in the yelp dataset, we focused on the restaurant. What's more, to reduce our work load we finally decided to analyse the restaurant in Pennsylvania.

## Structure:

A code file contains all the code for our analysis.

A data file includes all the data such as the origin yelp dataset, the restaurant in Pennsylvania, the positive words and negative words.

An image file contains all the figures we produced and used in the summary and slides.

A slide file includes two slides,each for one presentation.

An executive summary file include summary.pdf and summary.ipynb both summarize our analysis.
